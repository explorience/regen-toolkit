# ReFi DAO Integration (first pass)

## What it is
- Repository with governance, onboarding, and operational documents for ReFi DAO.
- Key observed sources include:
  - ReFi DAO 2.0 specifications/implementation
  - Network member onboarding guide
  - Additional governance and funding docs.

## Why it matters for regen-toolkit
- Strong source for practical DAO governance/onboarding patterns that can be adapted into toolkit modules.
- Provides concrete role, workflow, and tooling patterns (Guild, Charmverse, Hats, Gardens participation).

## Integration modes
- **Content:** convert governance/onboarding patterns into implementation guides and checklists.
- **Taxonomy:** map role/governance terminology (roles, workflows, objections, onboarding stages).
- **Workflow:** establish doc-to-playbook conversion process for high-signal governance assets.
- **Technical:** surface reusable templates/forms and metadata fields for structured indexing.

## Suggested sync cadence
- **Biweekly** for onboarding/governance updates.
- **After governance milestone changes** (new workflows/roles/templates).

## Candidate article topics
1. Consent-based optimistic governance patterns for local ReFi communities.
2. Building onboarding funnels with Guild + role attestations.
3. Translating DAO governance specs into practical local-node playbooks.
4. Gardens participation onboarding: from member role to proposal support.

## Risks/blockers
- Some docs are implementation-era snapshots and may not reflect latest live process.
- Tool-specific workflows can age quickly as platforms evolve.
- Large docs require careful chunking to avoid losing procedural detail.

## Next actions
1. Create a governance pattern library (roles, workflows, templates).
2. Extract a minimal onboarding blueprint from member guide + specs.
3. Mark sections as "stable vs evolving" to reduce stale-content risk.
