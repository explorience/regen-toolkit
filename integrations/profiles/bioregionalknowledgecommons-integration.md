# Bioregional Knowledge Commons Integration (first pass)

## What it is
- Local repository path: `03 Libraries/bioregionalknowledgecommons`
- Current observed state: repository skeleton only (`.git` present), no committed content files detected locally.
- Remote configured: `https://github.com/omniharmonic/bioregionalknowledgecommons.git`.

## Why it matters for regen-toolkit
- Intended as a potentially high-value source for bioregional/commons framing, which is core to regen-toolkit’s place-based orientation.
- Could become a bridge between conceptual bioregional knowledge and practical toolkit playbooks.

## Integration modes
- **Content:** blocked until source content is available locally.
- **Taxonomy:** can pre-map placeholder concepts (bioregion, commons, stewardship) and refine later.
- **Workflow:** add readiness check in integration workflow (`empty / minimal / usable`).
- **Technical:** once populated, index via same markdown ingestion flow used by `regen-toolkit-interface`.

## Suggested sync cadence
- **Weekly check** until content appears.
- Switch to **biweekly/monthly** after stable publication pattern exists.

## Candidate article topics
1. Bioregional Knowledge Commons: Why this layer matters for local implementation.
2. From commons theory to local ReFi playbooks.
3. Designing a bioregional vocabulary for interoperable regen docs.

## Risks/blockers
- Primary blocker: no local content to map yet.
- Unknown content structure and licensing assumptions until repository is populated.

## Next actions
1. Confirm with maintainers whether this repo should be populated or replaced by another source.
2. Add a minimal integration readiness checklist for empty repos.
3. Re-run profile pass immediately when first docs land (README, taxonomy, framework docs).
