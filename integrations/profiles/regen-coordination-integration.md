# Regen Coordination Integration (first pass)

## What it is
- Repository of strategy, round retrospectives, and positioning content for Regen Coordination.
- Key observed docs include:
  - AI + ImpactQF retrospective
  - Ethereum Localism x Regen Coordination positioning article
  - Local ReFi Toolkit drafting document

## Why it matters for regen-toolkit
- High-value source for narrative framing, methodology, and ecosystem-level strategy.
- Contains actionable frameworks for impact evaluation, cosmo-local coordination, and local funding round design.

## Integration modes
- **Content:** extract reusable frameworks, definitions, and process patterns into toolkit modules.
- **Taxonomy:** align terms like ImpactQF, CIDS/Common Approach, Ethereum Localism, TVF, local rounds.
- **Workflow:** set periodic synthesis from long-form strategy docs into concise toolkit artifacts.
- **Technical:** structured extraction (headings/sections) for indexing and cross-linking with toolkit tracks.

## Suggested sync cadence
- **Monthly** strategic sync.
- **Event-driven** updates after major round retrospectives or methodology changes.

## Candidate article topics
1. ImpactQF explained for toolkit operators.
2. Ethereum Localism as an implementation lens for local ReFi work.
3. Common Approach/CIDS in practical project reporting workflows.
4. Designing cosmo-local funding networks: global + bioregional + local layers.

## Risks/blockers
- Long-form narrative format can make extraction inconsistent without templates.
- Some claims are campaign/retrospective-context specific and need careful contextualization.
- Cross-doc terminology can shift over time.

## Next actions
1. Create a structured extraction template (What/Why/How/Metrics) for Regen Coordination docs.
2. Build a glossary seed from recurring terms in core documents.
3. Convert one retrospective into a reusable toolkit playbook skeleton.
