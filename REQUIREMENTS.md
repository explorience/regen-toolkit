## How to Use This Questionnaire

**You don't need to complete everything at once!** This questionnaire supports gradual development:

1. **Start with the essentials** (Sections 1-3): Target audiences, use cases, and priorities get you started
2. **Add details over time** (Sections 4-6): Fill in sources, technical specs, and contributor capacity as you go
3. **Refine and expand**: Come back to add more content or adjust priorities

Each section can be completed independently, allowing you to launch with minimal answers and grow organically.
