# Critical Paths Through the Toolkit

## The Idea

Rather than writing articles linearly (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3...) or haphazardly, identify **critical paths** for real use cases. Each path = minimum viable toolkit for that audience.

This helps us:
- Prioritize which articles to write first
- See which articles appear across multiple paths (high impact)
- Create curated learning journeys
- Deliver value faster to specific communities

## Implementation Ideas

### Option A: Explicit Paths in UI
- Homepage shows "Choose Your Path"
- Each path is a guided journey
- Progress tracking per path
- "You've completed 8/20 articles in the Tree Planter path"

### Option B: Tagged Articles
- Articles tagged with relevant paths
- Filter by path in search/browse
- "This article is part of: Global South Youth, Silvi"

### Option C: Internal Prioritization Only
- Use paths to decide writing order
- Don't surface to users
- Linear structure remains

## Questions for Team

1. Are these the right use cases? What others should we add?
2. Should paths be visible to users or just internal prioritization?
3. Who wants to "own" a path and validate the article selection?
4. Can we get input from actual users in each category?
