# Critical Paths Through the Toolkit

## The Idea

Rather than writing articles linearly (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3...) or haphazardly, identify **critical paths** for real use cases. Each path = minimum viable toolkit for that audience.

This helps us:
- Prioritize which articles to write first
- See which articles appear across multiple paths (high impact)
- Create curated learning journeys
- Deliver value faster to specific communities
