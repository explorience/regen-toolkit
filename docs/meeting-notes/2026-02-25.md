# Regen Toolkit Meeting Notes

**Attendees:** Heenal, mattycompost, afo, Rather

## Key Discussion: Restructuring the Toolkit

### The Problem
Current track-based structure creates duplication. Tracks function as both content structure AND user pathways — this is confusing.

### Proposed Solution: Tag-Based Structure

**Matty's Proposal:**
- Each article has **one canonical location**
- Tracks become **filter views**, not folders
- Add tagging system: `primary category`, `function`, `persona`, `maturity stage`

**Proposed Modules (not tracks):**
1. **Orientation** — Why Web3, blockchain, Ethereum, decentralization
2. **Web3 Literacy** — Basics (what most of Track 1 covered)
3. **Local Node Lifecycle** — Where you are in the local node journey
4. **Governance & Treasury** — DAO operations
5. **Capital & Funding** — Fundraising, grants
6. **Economic & Token Design** — Tokenomics
7. **Impact Architecture** — dMRV, credentials
8. **Community & Culture** — Building teams
9. **Risk & Resilience** — Security, compliance
10. **Operational** — Legal, admin

### Action: Matty will tidy up ontology + module structure into a spreadsheet and share options with the group.

## AI Writing Pipeline Update (Heenal)

**Pipeline stages:**
- Research → Write → Verify → Review → Critique → Publish
- Uses cheap models (~$0)
- Working docs (research, factcheck, critique) stored in repo alongside articles

**5 pilot articles completed** — ready for human review.

**Goal:** Get to V1 launch with whatever we have (50-150 articles), however imperfect, rather than waiting for perfection.

## Collaboration & Outreach

**Key insight:** Other groups are doing similar knowledge gardening work:
- **Ethereum Localism** — has ontology
- **ReFi Commons** — knowledge commons
- **Superbenefit** — here now

**Concern:** Don't want to recreate something others already have. Should reach out and collaborate.

**Relevant resources from Rather:**
- My (mostly formed) ontology is available here: https://knowledge-server.superbenefit.dev
- Simon Grant's interpretation of the knowledge commons ontology: https://growingcommons.substack.com/p/types-of-knowledge-commons-wiki-pages

## Action Items

| Who | What | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| Matty | Clean up ontology + module structure spreadsheet, share options | Pending |
| Heenal | Continue refining AI pipeline, think about presentation layer | Ongoing |
| Afo | Help create hub post for outreach | Pending |
| Rather | Share ReFi Commons ontology link | Done ✓ |
| Group | Reach out to Ethereum Localism, other knowledge gardeners | Future |

## Milestones

No hard deadlines set, but general agreement:
- Don't need all 250 articles for V1
- Release when structure is solid and we have useful content
- Set a target date to "go live" and ship what we have

## Additional Notes

- **GEO Protocol** — Rather mentioned Early Access program (requires application)
- **Funding focus** — Afo noted funding/money management is a huge gap in current toolkit and most important piece right now
- **Knowledge Commons working group** — Afo to post on ReFi Hub thread about connecting knowledge commons efforts
