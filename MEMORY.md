## Key Decisions

- [2026-06-15] **Master doc 2026-06-15 working iteration accepted as canonical** — Matty's latest (30,847 lines, up from 24,776). **Integration pass, not re-architecture** — the 10-layer core is stable. New: **Problem / Theory of Change formalized** (answers Durgadas's "theory of build vs theory of change" critique from 2026-05-21); **three-artifact model** (Heenal's v1 site + master doc + hub post) with "public ≠ commons"; **CSIS reframed "informed not conformant"** (3-level model + minimum enforceable safeguards); a *candidate* **Knowledge-Lifecycle spine** (Capture→Understand→Relate→Compose→Specify→Implement→Learn→Evolve→Steward→Interoperate) offered but NOT committed; 13-option Structure Options doc; resource DB design correction; Social Signal Scan + media/podcast layers; Contributor Roles formalized. Diff: [`docs/MASTER-DOC-CHANGES-2026-06-15.md`](docs/MASTER-DOC-CHANGES-2026-06-15.md). Previous archived at [`docs/archive/MASTER-2026-05-15-stabilization-draft.md`](docs/archive/MASTER-2026-05-15-stabilization-draft.md). **Per-layer docs/canvases deliberately NOT rebuilt** (architecture mid-decision; Matty: "integration pass, not full rewrite").
- [2026-06-15] **Framework vs. instance split** (Matty + Luiz work session) — formally separate the domain-agnostic *framework* (layers system, flows, processes, information architecture) from the *instance* (ReFi web3 content, specific resources/orgs). **ReFi Web3 Toolkit = the first concrete instance** of a reusable framework. Self-qualifying adoption (any org that adopts the structure + goes through the process) becomes the non-arbitrary **federation filtering function**. Strategic decision — to surface with the wider team; not executed unilaterally in repo structure. See `memory/2026-06-16.md` + `docs/reports/2026-06-15-toolkit-worksession-matty-integration-report.md`.
- [2026-06-15] **Explore housing the toolkit under ReFi Commons** as its organizational home (Matty: "100%"). Green Pill IP likely rolls fully into ReFi Commons (Walkie off-loading IP; Alpha + Gregor council); ReFi Commons exploring legal wrappers beneficial to the toolkit. Agreed posture: be giving/trusting on ReFi Commons + IP.
- [2026-06-15] **RegenOS to be documented** — the coordination layer above OrgOS instances mapping upstream/downstream repo relationships (currently only vaguely referenced in the master doc). Luiz to draft a short description into the master doc + a fuller infra-stack write-up; **draft RegenOS documentation + a simple public website targeting July** (new plan `docs/plans/regen-os-documentation.md`). Knowledge-source federation vs organizational federation likely **two distinct mechanisms**.
- [2026-06-15] **Coordination model: small bites + standards-led + high-trust scale** — not a big merger architecture. Identify fundable working groups both orgs agree on; standards stack = **CIDS + DAO IP5 + impact accounting/measurement tied to funding flows** (specific, academically rigorous). Scale to ~5–7 existing high-trust orgs / known people, **not open chapter calls**. Matty + Luiz named as the two to drive it.
- [2026-06-15] **Simplify infra first; Matty's compensation → seed an Impact Vault.** Don't settle final infra / on-chain storage now — GitHub + agents as backbone; Radicle / COI / on-chain are later layers. Matty's compensation preference: any funding the master-doc work earns should **seed an Impact Vault ("Oct and Vault")** sustaining the knowledge commons rather than be taken personally (details in his handoff doc, not yet in the latest iteration).
- [2026-06-04] **Two-deliverable strategy + "public ≠ commons"** (biweekly) — Heenal's simplified **v1 public site** (3 journeys: newcomers / local nodes / knowledge commoners) + a forthcoming **hub/forum post**, as paired deliverables. Heenal: something being public doesn't make it a commons until people use/correct/contribute/steward it → the hub post invites co-stewardship, not just announces a site. Swarm should not overdetermine the work. v1 merged to main (PR #311); live at regen-web3-toolkit.vercel.app. **Andrea + RegenOS** thread opened (deferred): Andrea = bioregional knowledge (bioregioning.org / Recover), candidate external contributor → seeds contribution-governance + compensation. Afo to funnel toolkit into the Greenpill Network site.
- [2026-05-21] **Theory of build vs theory of change** (biweekly; persona-game format superseded) — Durgadas's central challenge: the project risks being "a thing in search of a problem." Group agreed its highest-leverage move is to **author a revised problem + mission statement**; derive the theory of change from parent ecosystems (Green Pill + ReFi DAO) rather than invent fresh (Afo). "Transformational journeys" framing gained traction as shared direction (→ Heenal's v1 site). Rather deployed a forkable metadata ontology to Geo Protocol. Framework-vs-instance surfaced ("are we building the toolkit or the knowledge?", Koi). Unresolved: agree-on-problem (Koi) vs represent-priorities (Matty).
- [2026-05-15] **Master doc 2026-05-15 stabilization draft accepted as canonical** — Matty's second iteration in 9 days. ~24,776 lines (1.8× the 2026-05-06 doc). **Layer count 8 → 10**: Tracks restored (Layer 7); Infrastructure & Substrate added (Layer 10). 18 cross-cutting principles enumerated (4 new: Anti-Extractive Synthesis, Pattern Humility, Living Systems Health, Compost/Archive/Memory). Minimum Operating Kernel (Resource · Concept · Option · Deployment · Signal) introduced as v0.1 lens. CSIS reframed from "conformance" to "semantic overlay." See [`docs/MASTER-DOC-CHANGES-2026-05-15.md`](docs/MASTER-DOC-CHANGES-2026-05-15.md). Previous iteration archived at [`docs/archive/MASTER-2026-05-06-knowledge-commons-toolkit.md`](docs/archive/MASTER-2026-05-06-knowledge-commons-toolkit.md).
- [2026-05-15] **Per-layer documentation + canvas-per-layer structure established** — 10 layer docs at [`docs/layers/`](docs/layers/), 10 layer canvases at [`docs/canvases/layers/`](docs/canvases/layers/), master overview canvas at [`docs/canvases/regen-knowledge-commons-toolkit-master.canvas`](docs/canvases/regen-knowledge-commons-toolkit-master.canvas). Operator commitment from 2026-05-07 biweekly (Obsidian Canvas as visual architecture map) operationalized. Each layer doc derives from master doc — no synthesis ahead of preservation.
- [2026-05-07] **OrgOS adopted as the team's shared task management + contribution-tracking layer** — the existing org-os overlay on `feature/org-os-overlay` becomes the team's coordination surface. Process: compile to-dos → allocate among team → execute through Kanban pipeline. `HEARTBEAT.md` + `packages/webapps/task-manager/` are the working surface; KOI-bridge is the upgrade path once refi-dao Wave 2 ships.
- [2026-05-07] **Obsidian Canvas adopted as visual architecture mapping tool** — Barcelona bioregional garden as the worked example. Demoed live during the 2026-05-07 biweekly. Sharing limitation acknowledged (requires local Obsidian); web-based canvas remains exploratory carryover.
- [2026-05-07] **Persona / meta-game format adopted for next planning call (~2026-05-21)** — granular skill cards ("I can build a graph") over broad specialist titles. Intent: relational positioning over credentials, fun-first design philosophy.
- [2026-05-07] **Toolkit vs "Transformational Journeys" framing tension surfaced (Koi)** — pulls in different direction from the 2026-05-06 "Knowledge Commons Toolkit" rename. Not resolved on call. Folded into `master-doc-iteration-may-2026` Phase 2 reconciliation.
- [2026-05-07] **Bonfires (KOI stack, Brazil) recognized as methodological model + live infrastructure for the Evolution layer** — Caue Mtomaz ("Koi") demoed: design science research where participants are study subjects, multiple tracks per hypothesis, AI-audit data collection (NotebookLM, GPT, Bonfires), Telegram bot + entity mapping + cross-platform knowledge graph. Tight integration opportunity via the `mcp__regen-koi__*` toolset already running in this instance.
- [2026-05-06] **Master doc 2026-05-06 iteration is the working checkpoint** — replaced canonical `docs/MASTER.md` (now ~13.7k lines, renamed "Regen **Knowledge Commons** Toolkit"); previous saved at `docs/archive/MASTER-2026-04-23-regen-web3-toolkit.md`. Wholesale overlay rename + structural refactor sequenced post-Pulse-1 (`master-doc-iteration-may-2026.md`).
- [2026-04-26] **Resources lift (mechanical)** — 738 entries extracted from `MASTER.md` lines 1089–2668 into `data/resources.yaml` via `scripts/lift-resources.mjs`. Layer 1 (Resource Graph) now has a source-of-truth file. Pending Brandon's curation pass. *Note: re-lift against new MASTER.md scheduled for Phase 3.*
- [2026-04-24] **Org-os overlay landed** — toolkit now operates as its own org-os instance, co-located with the master doc. Framework sourced from upstream/main of `regen-coordination/org-os-template` (v3.0). See commit on `feature/org-os-overlay`.
- [2026-04-23] **Master doc handoff phase** — Matt one push from completing current iteration, then team takes ownership of individual layers. Resources tab weakest; dedicated organization session TBD.
- [2026-04-23] **Rather's ontology adopted as standard** for the toolkit ontology layer.
- [2026-04-23] **CSIS ↔ OrgoS alignment confirmed** — CSIS strict in Deployment layer, secondary in Feedback. Compatibility was the basis for bringing org-os in.
- [2026-04-23] **Frame language critique integrated** (Durgadas) — current docs use Frame 1 (extractive/hierarchical) language to describe regenerative processes. Next iteration to apply frame-language decomposition (Frame 3 → 2 → 1 with a ladder back up).
- [2026-04-23] **May hackathon target communities:** Geo Protocol (geobrowser.io — confirmed interest), Ethereum Localism (via Rather's Telegram outreach), Open Civics Consortium (Luiz to join chat).
- [2026-03-27] **Astro/Starlight site deployed** at regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app; 67 articles live out of 254-article inventory.

## Organizational History

- **[2026-01-15]** Project kickoff (Greenpill Toolkit Planning Call) — biweekly cadence established. Initial team: Matt, Trinity, Heenal, Monty, Luiz. Three target audiences agreed (university/governance education; communities needing onboarding e.g. Somaliland project; normie nonprofits). Built on prior Local ReFi Toolkit work from ReFi DAO.
- **[2026-01-29]** GitHub workflow established. 229 article placeholders created, tagged, prioritized into Tier 1/2 by audience overlap. Custom front-end planned for non-technical navigation.
- **[2026-02-12]** Content development workflow ratified — AI-assisted drafting, GitHub branch strategy, Artisan funding application planning.
- **[2026-02-14]** February consolidated action items report (`Zettelkasten/260214 February Meetings Action Items Report.md`) — 25+ actions for Luiz across ReFi BCN, ReFi DAO, Regen Coordination, and the toolkit; major themes captured.
- **[2026-02-25]** Restructure decision: tag-based architecture replaces track-based. 10 modules proposed. Rather's ontology entered the picture as a candidate standard. AI pipeline 5-stage live with 5 pilot articles.
- **[2026-03-12]** Artisan funding application strategy: single Region Coordination profile covering toolkit + knowledge gardening. AI pipeline hit blockers (broken + credit issues). Co-op browser extension idea floated by Luiz (foreshadows Coop PL Genesis).
- **[2026-03-26]** Astro/Starlight site migrated into monorepo (PR #304). 67 articles published out of 254-article inventory; 5 learning paths live.
- **[2026-04-23]** Frame-language critique introduced (Durgadas). Master doc handoff phase begins. CSIS × org-os alignment posture established. May hackathon target communities locked in.
- **[2026-04-25]** Org-os overlay landed on `feature/org-os-overlay` branch. Toolkit operates as its own org-os instance, co-located with master doc, structured registries, agent skills.
- **[2026-04-26]** Meeting history bootstrapped from personal vault into `packages/operations/meetings/`.
- **[2026-05-06]** Master doc 2026-05-06 iteration intake: rename to "Regen Knowledge Commons Toolkit", layer set restructured (Tracks dropped, Concept & Idea Ecology added, Implementation Memory + Evolution split, Ontology promoted to Layer 1), Knowledge Commoning Swarm reframing introduced. Wholesale rename refactor sequenced for post-Pulse-1.
- **[2026-05-07]** Biweekly planning call: OrgOS adopted as shared task management; Obsidian Canvas adopted as visual architecture map; persona/game format adopted for next call; Bonfires (KOI stack) recognized as Evolution-layer methodological model; Toolkit vs Transformational Journeys framing tension surfaced.
- **[2026-05-09–10]** OpenCivics Knowledge Commoning Swarm Pulse 1 (partial team attendance — Matty in Philadelphia). Retro still owed.
- **[2026-05-15]** Master doc 2026-05-15 stabilization draft landed. 10-layer architecture (Tracks restored, Infrastructure added). 18 cross-cutting principles. Per-layer documentation + Obsidian canvas-per-layer structure established. Phase 3 structured refactor sequenced post-2026-05-21 biweekly.
- **[2026-05-21]** Biweekly (persona-game format superseded). Durgadas's "theory of build vs theory of change" challenge dominated; group agreed to author a revised problem + mission statement; derive ToC from Green Pill + ReFi DAO; journeys framing gained traction; Rather deployed a forkable ontology to Geo Protocol. Luiz absent.
- **[2026-06-04]** Biweekly. Two paired deliverables: Heenal's v1 public site (3 journeys, merged to main / PR #311, live at regen-web3-toolkit.vercel.app) + a hub post. "Public ≠ commons." Andrea + RegenOS thread opened (deferred). Afo → Greenpill Network integration. Matty drafting a Regen Coordination budget/scope doc.
- **[2026-06-15]** Ad-hoc Matty + Luiz work session. Matty walked through his master-doc artifacts (GPT handoff docs, next working draft, structure-options doc, unified resource index); Luiz demoed the OrgOS overlay end-to-end + articulated RegenOS as the federation layer. Two strategic moves: **framework/instance split** + **house the toolkit under ReFi Commons**. Coordination model agreed (small bites, CIDS + DAO IP5 + impact accounting, scale to high-trust orgs). Matty's compensation → Impact Vault. RegenOS documentation + public website queued for July.
- **[2026-06-16]** Gap-fill + master-doc intake: 2026-05-21 + 2026-06-04 biweeklies processed; new master doc (2026-06-15 working iteration, 30,847 lines) saved canonical + 2026-05-15 archived; resource DB V3 (28 sheets / 12,456 rows) staged at `data/resources/`. Convergence (site merge, branch cleanup, framework/instance split, full resource lift) sequenced behind an operator checkpoint.

---

## Active Context

- [CHECKPOINT — awaiting operator] **Convergence** — (1) site merge: overlay still on the old 67-article taxonomy site; main has Heenal's live 3-journey v1 (needs `vault:snapshot` + content reconciliation, 225 vs 119 article files); (2) full resource-DB V3 lift (crosswalk-driven); (3) branch cleanup; (4) framework/instance split execution. See integration report + `memory/2026-06-16.md`.
- [new workstream] **Revised problem + mission statement** (from 2026-05-21) — the still-open piece of Durgadas's theory-of-change challenge; now has a master-doc home (Problem/ToC section).
- [tracked, don't pre-empt] **Knowledge-Lifecycle spine vs 10 layers** — the new master doc offers a lifecycle reorganization as a candidate; architecture decision pending.
- [queued] **CSIS posture revision** (`docs/CSIS.md` → "informed not conformant" + 3-level model) — the new master doc formalizes it.
- [deferred] **Andrea + RegenOS conversation** — bioregional knowledge (bioregioning.org / Recover) → contribution-governance + compensation.
- [2026-06-15+ strategic] **Framework / instance split** — surface to wider team; reshapes how master doc + repos are organized. Not executed unilaterally.
- [2026-06-15+ strategic] **ReFi Commons as organizational home** — open the conversation (Luiz + Matty); coordinate with Green Pill IP roll-in.
- [July target] **RegenOS documentation + simple public website** — new plan `docs/plans/regen-os-documentation.md`. Precedes/feeds the three external Google-Doc contributions (RegenOS description, OrgOS overlay link, infra-stack write-up — draft-and-present before sending).
- [pending] **Review Geo Browser** (geobrowser.io); slot into the infra-stack write-up.
- [ongoing, joint] **Coordination model with Matty** — identify first fundable working group (small bite); advance CIDS + DAO IP5 + impact accounting; sketch the Impact Vault funding flow.
- [this week 2026-05-15+] Phase E + Phase F of `master-doc-iteration-may-15-2026` — `data/ontology/` + `data/option-library.yaml` + `data/feedback-process.yaml` refactor; `data/tracks.yaml` creation; new `scripts/lift-*.mjs` per layer; root-MD rename pass; IDENTITY.md + ORG-OS.md updates
- [~2026-05-21 biweekly] Persona / meta-game format — team brings role/skill cards. **Surface 10-layer canvases as visual entry point. Resolve layer ownership** against new candidates (Koi for L8 + L9; Matt for L4; Heenal returning to L7).
- [owed] Pulse 1 retro (2026-05-09–10) — feeds Swarm Contribution Pack v0.1 scope adjustment + Toolkit-vs-Journeys framing decision
- [ongoing] Layer ownership debt — Heenal returns to L7 Tracks (restored); Koi candidate for L8 + L9; Matt candidate for L4 Concept & Idea Ecology; L10 Infrastructure default to Luiz
- [ongoing] Frame-language audit (Durgadas) — now has dedicated home at master doc §16.8 (Backlog) + architectural home at L4
- [ongoing] Toolkit vs "Transformational Journeys" framing tension (Koi) — *not addressed by 2026-05-15 iteration*; surface to Matty + Koi async; observe Pulse 1 framing language
- [ongoing] Brandon's curation pass on `data/resources.yaml` — gated on Phase 3 re-lift completion
- [until ~2026-05-end] May hackathon outreach and prep — Pulse 1 + 2-month hackathon now overlapping

## Relationship Map

### Network & Peers
- **Regen Coordination Network** — parent network; toolkit is a project node.
- **regen-coordination-os** — peer instance (canonical trust); coordinates the broader network hub.
- **ReFi BCN** — local chapter / origin of some toolkit contributors (Luiz).

### Upstream
- **org-os-template** (`github.com/regen-coordination/org-os-template`) — framework source; overlay target.

### Community Ties
- **ReFi Commons** — candidate **organizational home** for the toolkit (raised 2026-06-15). Green Pill IP likely rolling in (Walkie off-loading; Alpha + Gregor council); exploring legal wrappers. Vehicle for acknowledging/compensating Matty's master-doc work (Impact Vault).
- **Green Pill** — IP likely consolidating into ReFi Commons; one of the two anchor orgs (with ReFi DAO) for the coordination model + standards stack.
- **Geo Protocol** (geobrowser.io) — knowledge-focused web3 project; confirmed interest in hackathon. **Geo Browser flagged for review (Luiz, 2026-06-15)** as an infra-stack candidate.
- **Ethereum Localism** — target community for hackathon invite via Rather.
- **Open Civics Consortium** — Knowledge Commoning Swarm host; Pulse 1 on 2026-05-09–10; applications review starting May.
- **Bread Co-op** — forthcoming org-os instance; research/sharing channel as eventual feedback-layer source.
- **Bonfires / regen-koi** (Caue "Koi" Mtomaz, Brazil) — KOI stack: Telegram bot + entity mapping + cross-platform knowledge graph; demoed 2026-05-07 as methodological model for Evolution layer. Already integrated via `mcp__regen-koi__*` toolset.
- **Greenpill Network** (Afo) — Afo wants to funnel the toolkit into the Greenpill Network site ("garden → house"); leverage branding/podcast reach; possible agent-skills for AI to reference the toolkit. Raised 2026-06-04.
- **Andrea / bioregioning** — bioregional-knowledge practitioner (bioregioning.org / Recover) connected via Luiz; candidate external knowledge contributor + trigger for the RegenOS / contribution-governance conversation. Raised 2026-06-04.
- **Heenal's v1 public site** — `regen-web3-toolkit.vercel.app` (Astro/Starlight, 3 onboarding journeys, 52 hand-checked articles). Heenal owns. Distinct from the older `regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app` (67-article taxonomy site the overlay branch still carries). Site convergence pending.
