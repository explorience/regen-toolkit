# Master Onboarding Guide: Starting a ReFi Local Node

Welcome, future Local Node Leader! This guide walks you through the complete journey of establishing a ReFi Local Node—from initial alignment with the network to full activation as an officially recognized regenerative community.

## What is a ReFi Local Node?

A **ReFi Local Node** is a place-based community that serves as a living laboratory for regenerative finance in your region. Local Nodes:

- **Build local regenerative economies** through events, media, software, capital raising, and land projects
- **Experiment with and implement** ReFi tools and practices in contextually appropriate ways
- **Operate with regional autonomy** while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's global mission
- **Share knowledge and learnings** with the broader network to accelerate collective impact

The onboarding process is designed to ensure each Local Node aligns with shared values, understands commitments and benefits, receives initial funding support, and builds capacity to lead regenerative transformation in their bioregion.

## Phase 1: Network Alignment (Become a Network Member)

Before launching a Local Node, you must first join the ReFi DAO network as a member. This foundational step affirms your alignment with the collective mission, vision, and values.

### Join ReFi DAO's Garden

ReFi DAO uses [Gardens](https://gardens.fund/), a decentralized funding platform, for membership and governance. To join:

1. **Connect your wallet** to the Gardens platform
2. **Review and sign the Community Covenant**—this document outlines ReFi DAO's mission, vision, values, and member commitments
3. **Complete the registration process** to become a Network Member

The [ReFi DAO Community Covenant](/1-foundations/1.8-daos/refi-dao-governance/) establishes the ethical and cultural foundation of the network. By signing, you commit to principles of regeneration, empowerment, transparency, and regenerative leadership.

### Verify Your Membership

Once joined, your membership is confirmed on-chain, granting you access to participate in community governance and funding decisions. Network Members can:

- Participate in governance discussions
- Support proposals in Gardens funding pools
- Access basic community resources
- Progress toward more active roles

## Phase 2: Preparation (Understand the Framework)

Before submitting a proposal, thoroughly review the Local Node framework to ensure you understand the commitments, benefits, and expectations.

### Review the Local Node Membership Agreement

The [Local Node Membership Agreement](https://www.notion.so/ReFi-DAO-Local-Node-Membership-Agreement-v1-201bf304370a8038a898e7ba76319fc1) establishes the terms for official recognition. Key elements include:

**Benefits of Membership:**
- **Brand License**: Revocable, non-exclusive license to use ReFi DAO brand assets (name, logo, templates)
- **Official Listing**: Promotion in the Local Node Directory and across ReFi DAO channels
- **Community Access**: Gated coordination spaces, bi-monthly calls, and peer networks
- **Toolkit Access**: Full access to the Local Node Toolkit and Local ReFi Toolkit
- **Funding Eligibility**: Access to ReFi DAO grant rounds and ecosystem funding partners
- **Governance Participation**: Progressive reputation and recognition for active contributors

**Core Commitments:**
- Uphold ethical standards and cultural norms from the Community Covenant
- Use ReFi DAO brand responsibly according to Brand Guidelines
- Maintain active visibility through regular updates (via Karma GAP or equivalent)
- Avoid misrepresentation of ReFi DAO's mission or relationships

### Study Successful Node Models

Review existing Local Node case studies to understand diverse approaches:

- **ReFi Costa Rica**: Community currencies and crypto philanthropy
- **ReFi Barcelona**: Cooperative structures and bioregional coordination
- **ReFi Lagos**: Plastic waste to value chains
- **ReFi Tanzania**: Community verification systems

## Phase 3: Proposal & Funding (Secure Initial Resources)

With alignment established and framework understood, you're ready to propose your Local Node and secure seed funding.

### Submit a Proposal on Gardens

ReFi DAO maintains a **Local Node Kickstarter Pool** with **3,000 USDGLO** dedicated to funding new Local Nodes. Each proposal can request up to **500 USDGLO** for initial activities like events, workshops, and community building.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Must be a newly formed or recently launched Local Node
- Proposal must include a clear activity plan (events, workshops, community building)
- Must align with the ReFi DAO Community Covenant
- Maximum request: 500 USDGLO

**Proposal Components:**
1. **Team bios** with relevant skills, experience, and prior work
2. **Project deliverables**, cost breakdown, and timeframe
3. **Links, demos, or resources** to help voters learn about your vision

**How Conviction Voting Works:**

Gardens uses **conviction voting**—a novel mechanism that rewards sustained support:

- Support grows **50% every 7 days** you maintain your position
- This prevents last-minute manipulation and rewards genuine community belief
- When proposals reach the conviction threshold, funding is released automatically
