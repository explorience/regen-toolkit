# The Funding Landscape

## In This Article

This article maps the diverse funding landscape available to regenerative projects and Local Nodes. We explore traditional and Web3-native funding mechanisms, from quadratic funding and retroactive public goods funding to grants, investments, and community currencies. Understanding this landscape helps projects build resilient, diversified funding strategies.

## The Core Idea

Funding regenerative work requires moving beyond traditional charity models toward mechanisms that align incentives, distribute decision-making, and create sustainable revenue streams. The Web3 ecosystem has pioneered several innovative funding approaches that complement and sometimes replace traditional grants and donations.

The funding landscape for ReFi projects includes:
- **Quadratic Funding**: Democratic allocation where many small donors outweigh few large ones
- **Retroactive Public Goods Funding**: Paying for proven impact rather than promised potential
- **Tokenized Impact**: Creating tradable assets representing environmental outcomes
- **Community Currencies**: Local money systems that keep value circulating locally
- **Regenerative Investment**: Capital that generates returns while restoring ecosystems
- **Traditional Grants**: Foundations, government programs, and institutional funders
- **DAO Treasuries**: Community-governed pools allocating resources to shared priorities

No single funding source is sufficient for most regenerative projects. Successful initiatives typically combine multiple mechanisms—perhaps Gitcoin Grants for community building, impact tokens for verification revenue, traditional grants for operational costs, and regenerative investment for scaling. This diversification creates resilience against funding volatility and aligns incentives across different stakeholder groups.

The key insight is that funding isn't just about money—it's about governance, community engagement, and incentive alignment. Quadratic funding builds community through participation. Retroactive funding rewards proven impact. Tokenized assets create ongoing revenue from environmental outcomes. Each mechanism brings different benefits beyond the capital itself.

## Why This Matters for Regens

For regenerative practitioners, understanding the funding landscape is essential for project survival and impact. Many promising initiatives fail not from lack of vision or community need, but from funding gaps or unsustainable financial models.

**Access to Capital**: ReFi projects often fall between traditional funding categories—too technology-focused for environmental grants, too impact-focused for tech investment. Web3-native funding mechanisms fill this gap, providing capital for projects that don't fit traditional boxes. Local Nodes serve as crucial bridges, helping local projects access these global funding pools.

**Community Building**: Many Web3 funding mechanisms double as community-building tools. Quadratic funding campaigns mobilize supporters who become ongoing stakeholders. Token launches create communities of aligned holders. This means funding activities can simultaneously build the social infrastructure necessary for long-term success.

**Sustainable Models**: Traditional grant dependency creates vulnerability—when grants end, projects often collapse. The new funding landscape enables sustainable models: ongoing revenue from impact tokens, community currencies that generate seigniorage, regenerative investments that provide returns while creating impact. Projects can build toward financial sustainability rather than perpetual fundraising.

**Democratic Allocation**: Traditional funding concentrates decision-making in the hands of program officers and investment committees. Web3 mechanisms democratize these decisions, letting communities allocate resources through quadratic voting, token governance, or retroactive evaluation. This aligns funding with community priorities rather than funder preferences.

**Proof of Impact**: New funding mechanisms increasingly require verifiable impact data. Retroactive funding pays for demonstrated outcomes. Impact tokens require verification. This creates incentives for robust monitoring and evaluation—good for funders and for projects learning to demonstrate their value.

**Global Access**: Web3 funding transcends geographic boundaries. A regenerative agriculture project in Kenya can access the same Gitcoin Grants pool as a project in California. This democratizes access to capital, though it requires internet connectivity and some technical capacity—areas where Local Nodes provide crucial support.

## Key Concepts

### Quadratic Funding (QF)

Quadratic Funding is a matching mechanism where the number of contributors matters more than the amount contributed. Projects receive matching funds proportional to the square of the sum of square roots of contributions. In practice, this means 100 people giving $1 each generates more matching than 1 person giving $100. Gitcoin Grants is the largest QF platform, distributing over $60M to public goods projects.

### Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)

RetroPGF pays for impact that has already occurred rather than promising future results. Projects demonstrate their impact, a community evaluates the value created, and funding is allocated retroactively. This reduces risk for funders and rewards proven contributors. Optimism's RetroPGF program is the most prominent example, distributing millions to projects that have benefited the Optimism ecosystem.

### Impact Tokens and Natural Capital

Impact tokens represent verified environmental outcomes—carbon sequestered, biodiversity restored, water quality improved. These tokens can be sold to buyers wanting to offset impacts or support regeneration. Unlike traditional carbon credits, blockchain-based impact tokens offer greater transparency, fractional ownership, and programmable features. Projects like Toucan Protocol, Moss, and Regen Network enable this tokenization. [[what-is-refi]]

### Community Currencies

Local currencies issued on blockchain keep value circulating within communities rather than leaking to external economies. These currencies can be designed to incentivize regenerative behaviors—rewarding local purchasing, sustainable practices, or community participation. They create local economic sovereignty and reduce dependence on volatile national currencies. Examples include the Cambiatus currencies in Latin America and the Kolektivo currency in Curaçao.

### Regenerative Investment

Unlike extractive investment that maximizes financial returns regardless of impact, regenerative investment seeks returns through restoring rather than depleting living systems. This includes:
- **ReFi VC**: Venture capital specifically for regenerative projects
- **Impact DAOs**: Investment DAOs focused on environmental and social returns
- **Natural capital markets**: Investment in ecosystem restoration with returns from ecosystem services
- **Staking for impact**: Locking tokens to support regenerative protocols while earning yield

### Grant DAOs and Foundations

Traditional philanthropic funding remains important, often providing the patient capital needed for early-stage projects. Web3-native grant DAOs like Gitcoin, Giveth, and protocol-specific foundations (Ethereum Foundation, Celo Foundation) offer significant funding with more flexible requirements than traditional foundations. ReFi DAO itself operates Gardens pools for Local Node funding.

### Conviction Voting

Conviction voting is a governance mechanism where voting power increases over time as participants maintain their position. Applied to funding, this means projects receive more funding as community conviction in their value grows. This reduces gaming and rewards sustained community support rather than temporary hype. Gardens.fund uses conviction voting for Local Node funding allocation.

## Common Questions

**Which funding mechanism is best for my project?**

There's no single best mechanism—it depends on your project stage, community size, impact type, and team capacity. Early-stage projects often start with grants and quadratic funding to build community. Projects with measurable outcomes can explore impact tokens. Mature projects might pursue regenerative investment. Most successful projects use multiple mechanisms. Start with what's accessible and diversify over time.

**How do I access Web3 funding without technical expertise?**

Local Nodes provide crucial support here. They can help with wallet setup, application processes, and technical requirements. Many funding platforms have simplified interfaces for non-technical users. You can also partner with technically skilled community members or hire Web3-native consultants. Don't let technical barriers stop you—focus on your impact and find collaborators for the technical pieces.

**What's the difference between donations and investments in ReFi?**

Donations don't expect financial returns—they're gifts supporting public goods. Investments expect returns, though regenerative investments may accept below-market returns for impact. Quadratic funding and grants are donation-based. Impact tokens and regenerative VC are investment-based. Many projects combine both: donations for public goods aspects, investments for revenue-generating components.

**How do I demonstrate impact to funders?**

Different mechanisms require different proof levels. Quadratic funding relies on community support as validation. RetroPGF requires demonstrated impact metrics. Impact tokens need third-party verification. Traditional grants want clear theories of change and monitoring plans. Start documenting your impact from day one: photos, testimonials, quantitative metrics, before/after comparisons. Use tools like KarmaGAP for milestone tracking and Hypercerts for impact certification.

**Can traditional nonprofits participate in Web3 funding?**

Yes, though there may be legal and operational considerations. Many traditional nonprofits successfully raise funds through Gitcoin and Giveth. You'll need to set up a crypto wallet and may need board approval for accepting cryptocurrency donations. Some mechanisms like token launches may not be appropriate for nonprofits. Consult with legal counsel familiar with both nonprofit law and crypto regulations.

**How do I build a sustainable funding mix?**

Aim for diversification across mechanisms and timeframes. Include some quick-win sources (quadratic funding rounds) and some long-term sources (recurring donations, investment revenue). Balance restricted funding (grants for specific projects) with unrestricted funding (general operating support). Build toward revenue-generating activities that reduce dependency on external funding.
