# Gitcoin Grants and Quadratic Funding

## In This Article

This article provides a practical guide to Gitcoin Grants and quadratic funding for regenerative projects. We explain how the mechanism works, why it's particularly powerful for ReFi initiatives, and provide actionable steps for running successful funding rounds. Whether you're a Local Node seeking support or a project building regenerative infrastructure, understanding quadratic funding can transform your fundraising strategy.

## The Core Idea

Gitcoin Grants is the premier platform for quadratic funding (QF)—a democratic mechanism for funding public goods that ensures broad community support generates significant matching funds. Since 2017, Gitcoin has distributed over $60 million to more than 3,700 projects, making it one of the most significant funding sources for Web3 public goods.

The magic of quadratic funding lies in its formula: **matching amount equals the square of the sum of square roots of contributions**. In practice, this means the number of contributors matters more than the amount contributed. A project with 100 people giving $1 each receives more matching than a project with one person giving $100.

This design democratizes funding allocation. Traditional grant programs concentrate decision-making in the hands of program officers or wealthy donors. Quadratic funding lets communities signal their priorities through participation. Projects that genuinely serve community needs attract many small supporters, which generates substantial matching. This aligns funding with grassroots demand rather than top-down preferences.

For regenerative projects, this is revolutionary. Local environmental initiatives often serve communities that aren't wealthy but deeply care about outcomes. Quadratic funding lets these communities direct significant resources to projects they value, even if individual contributions are small. A community of 50 people each giving $5 can direct thousands in matching to a local reforestation project.

Gitcoin operates in rounds—typically quarterly funding events where projects apply, communities donate, and matching pools are distributed according to the QF formula. The platform uses Gitcoin Passport for sybil resistance, ensuring that matching goes to genuine community support rather than fake accounts gaming the system.

## Why This Matters for Regens

Quadratic funding through Gitcoin Grants offers regenerative projects unique advantages that traditional fundraising cannot match.

**Community Building as Fundraising**: Traditional fundraising treats donors as ATMs—sources of money to be tapped. Quadratic funding treats donors as stakeholders to be engaged. The mechanism requires mobilizing many people, which naturally builds community around your project. Donors become advocates, volunteers, and ongoing supporters. The funding process itself strengthens your project's social fabric.

**Validation of Demand**: Matching based on contributor count provides market validation. If you can't attract 20 people to give small amounts, perhaps your project hasn't found product-market fit. This honest feedback helps projects pivot or improve before scaling. Conversely, strong community response signals genuine demand, helping attract additional investment and partnerships.

**Access to Significant Matching**: Gitcoin matching pools often exceed $1 million per round. For a Local Node or regenerative project, this can mean tens of thousands in matching funds from relatively small community donations. The leverage is extraordinary—$500 in community donations might generate $5,000 or more in matching, depending on the round and competition.

**Network Effects**: Successful Gitcoin participation builds reputation in the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Projects that perform well gain visibility, partnership opportunities, and access to follow-on funding. The Gitcoin community includes influential developers, investors, and protocol leaders who might discover your work through the platform.

**Alignment with Values**: Quadratic funding embodies values central to ReFi: decentralization, community governance, and public goods provision. Using this mechanism aligns your project's funding model with its mission. You're not just raising money; you're demonstrating that regenerative economics works.

**Lower Barriers to Entry**: Unlike venture capital or foundation grants, Gitcoin Grants has relatively low barriers. You don't need warm introductions, perfect pitch decks, or Silicon Valley connections. You need a project serving public goods and a community willing to support it. This democratizes access to capital for underserved communities and regions.

## Key Concepts

### The Quadratic Funding Formula

The matching formula is: **(√c₁ + √c₂ + ... + √cₙ)²** where c represents individual contributions.

Example comparison:
- One donor gives $100: √100 = 10 → matching = $100
- 100 donors give $1 each: (√1 × 100)² = 10,000 → matching = $10,000

This demonstrates how broad community support generates exponentially more matching than concentrated large donations.

### Gitcoin Passport

Passport is Gitcoin's identity verification system, essential for maximizing matching. Users verify their humanity through "stamps"—verifiable credentials from various sources:
- **Web3 Activity**: ENS, GitHub, previous Gitcoin contributions
- **Social**: Twitter, Lens, Farcaster verification
- **Biometrics**: Face uniqueness, liveness checks
- **KYC**: Government ID, phone verification
- **Web of Trust**: Connections to verified humans

Higher Passport scores increase matching weight. Projects should encourage supporters to build their Passport scores before donating.

### Matching Eligibility and Caps

Different rounds have different eligibility criteria and matching caps. Some rounds are open to all public goods; others focus on specific categories (climate, open source, community). Matching caps prevent any single project from capturing too much of the pool, ensuring distribution across many initiatives. Check round-specific rules when planning your application.

### ReFi DAO's Gitcoin History

ReFi DAO has successfully participated in multiple Gitcoin rounds:
- **GG18 Local Node Beta Round**: $30,000 matching pool funded 18 Local Nodes
- **GG19 Web3 Community & Education**: ReFi DAO Global plus 11 Local Nodes participated
- **GG20+**: Ongoing participation with increasing sophistication

Top-performing nodes in GG18 included ReFi Medellín (109 contributions), ReFi Lagos (70), and ReFi México (69), demonstrating that diverse global communities can succeed.

### Application Best Practices

Successful applications typically include:
- **Clear problem statement**: What are you solving and for whom?
- **Demonstrated traction**: Evidence of community support, past impact, or working products
- **Transparent budget**: How will funds be used?
- **Compelling narrative**: Why should people care? Use stories, not just statistics
- **Active team**: Evidence that you can execute (GitHub activity, event photos, community engagement)
- **Update commitments**: Promise regular updates on progress

### Campaign Strategy

Running a successful QF campaign requires:
- **Early community mobilization**: Start building supporter lists weeks before the round
- **Multi-channel outreach**: Social media, email, community calls, partner networks
- **Progress updates**: Share milestones during the round to maintain momentum
- **Transparency**: Be open about challenges as well as successes
- **Gratitude**: Thank supporters publicly and personally
- **Passport education**: Help supporters optimize their matching by building Passport scores

## Common Questions

**Do I need to be a nonprofit to apply?**

No—Gitcoin funds public goods regardless of legal structure. DAOs, informal groups, and individuals can apply. However, having a clear governance structure and transparent operations helps build donor trust. Some rounds may have specific eligibility requirements, so check the current guidelines.

**How much can we realistically raise?**

This varies widely based on project appeal, community size, and round competitiveness. Local Nodes in the ReFi DAO network have raised $2,000-$15,000 in single rounds. The key factors are: size of your community, strength of your narrative, and effectiveness of your mobilization strategy. Smaller communities with strong engagement often outperform larger but less engaged ones.

**What are the costs and fees?**

Gitcoin takes no fees from donations. You'll pay Ethereum gas fees for transactions, though these are minimal on Layer 2 networks like Optimism or Arbitrum that Gitcoin now supports. The main cost is time—planning, campaigning, and donor relations require significant effort. Consider this an investment in community building, not just fundraising.

**How do we handle the technical aspects?**

You'll need an Ethereum wallet (MetaMask or similar) to receive funds. If this is new to you, seek help from your Local Node or the ReFi DAO community. The actual application process is straightforward web forms. Donors also need wallets, which can be a barrier for non-crypto supporters. Consider offering education or accepting traditional donations that team members convert.

**What if we don't have a large community yet?**

Focus on quality over quantity. A small group of committed early supporters can generate meaningful matching and build momentum. Participate in rounds even if your community is small—it's good practice, builds visibility, and every round teaches you something. Over time, consistent participation builds reputation and community.

**Can we apply to multiple rounds?**

Yes, and you should. Regular participation builds familiarity with your work. Update your project description with progress from previous rounds. Returning donors become ongoing supporters. Just ensure you deliver on promises made in previous rounds.

**How do we compete with larger, established projects?**

Don't try to compete on total funding—compete on community engagement per supporter. Smaller projects often have higher engagement rates because supporters feel personally connected. Focus on your niche, tell your unique story, and mobilize your community authentically. The QF formula rewards broad support more than concentrated large donations.
