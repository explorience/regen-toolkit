# Greenpill Planning Boards

Visual planning materials from the Greenpill Network's toolkit development process, including Miro boards and Figma designs.

## Overview

During the planning phase of Greenpill toolkit development, visual collaboration tools were used to map content, design user flows, and organize ideas. These boards capture that visual thinking.

## Key Sections

- **Content Maps**: Visual organization of toolkit topics
- **User Flows**: How users would navigate the toolkit
- **Design Mockups**: Early visual design concepts
- **Brainstorm Outputs**: Captured ideas from planning sessions

## When to Reference

- Looking for visual representations of content relationships
- Understanding intended user experience
- Finding design inspiration
- Reviewing brainstorm outputs for missed ideas

## Content Highlights

Visual planning materials often capture relationships and hierarchies that text documents miss. These boards may reveal structural thinking that informs content organization.

## Integration Notes

Access to these boards may require Greenpill Network membership or specific permissions. Contact the Greenpill team if you need access for Regen Toolkit development.

## Status Notes
