# ReFi DAO Local ReFi Toolkit

The ReFi DAO Local ReFi Toolkit is a comprehensive resource for communities looking to implement regenerative finance at the local level. Built by ReFi DAO, it provides practical guidance for launching and sustaining local ReFi initiatives.

## Overview

This toolkit serves as one of the primary foundations for the Regen Toolkit project. It contains 19 content pieces covering various aspects of local regenerative finance, from community organizing to protocol implementations.

## Key Sections

- **Getting Started**: Introduction to local ReFi concepts and community organizing
- **Playbooks**: Step-by-step guides for specific implementations
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples from existing local ReFi nodes
- **Protocol Implementations**: Technical guides for deploying regenerative protocols locally

## When to Reference

- Starting a new local ReFi initiative
- Looking for proven implementation patterns
- Seeking case studies to learn from
- Need technical protocol guidance

## Content Highlights

The toolkit emphasizes practical, actionable content that has been tested by real communities. It bridges the gap between high-level ReFi philosophy and on-the-ground implementation.

## Integration Notes

Many concepts from this toolkit are directly incorporated into the Regen Toolkit, with attribution and links back to the original source. When expanding on topics covered here, check this source first for existing content.
