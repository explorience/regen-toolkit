# Web3 Starter Kit

The Web3 Starter Kit is a GitHub repository providing developer templates and boilerplate code for building web3 applications.

## Overview

Created by Oba-One, this starter kit helps developers quickly bootstrap web3 projects with best practices and common patterns already implemented. It reduces the friction of starting new web3 development projects.

## Key Sections

- **Project Templates**: Ready-to-use project structures
- **Smart Contract Examples**: Common contract patterns
- **Frontend Boilerplate**: Web3-connected UI templates
- **Configuration**: Standard tooling setup
- **Documentation**: Setup and usage guides

## When to Reference

- Building technical components for local initiatives
- Need code templates for common patterns
- Starting a new web3 development project
- Looking for implementation examples

## Content Highlights

The starter kit is practical and ready to use. It represents current best practices for web3 development tooling and structure.

## Integration Notes

For technical content in the Regen Toolkit that requires code examples or development guidance, this repository provides a solid foundation. It's especially useful for the more technical playbooks.

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Understanding of web3 concepts

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oba-One/web3-starter-kit
