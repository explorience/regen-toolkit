# Reimagining Power

Reimagining Power is a collection of case studies and patterns from SuperBenefit documenting real-world applications of new organizational and governance models.

## Overview

SuperBenefit has compiled extensive documentation of their work helping organizations reimagine power structures using web3 tools and decentralized principles. This collection represents tested, real-world implementations.

## Key Sections

- **Case Studies**: Detailed documentation of real projects
- **Pattern Library**: Reusable patterns extracted from experience
- **Governance Models**: Tested approaches to distributed decision-making
- **Organizational Structures**: New forms of organization in practice
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't, and why

## When to Reference

- Need real-world examples of decentralized governance
- Looking for tested patterns rather than theory
- Want to learn from actual implementations
- Seeking evidence-based recommendations

## Content Highlights

The strength of Reimagining Power is that everything documented has been tested in real organizations. These aren't theoretical patterns - they're documented from practice.

## Integration Notes

For Regen Toolkit content that needs credibility through real examples, Reimagining Power is the primary source. When making recommendations, reference specific cases from this collection.
