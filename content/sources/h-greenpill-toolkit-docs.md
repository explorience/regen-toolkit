# Greenpill Toolkit Planning Docs

These are the original planning documents for the Greenpill Toolkit project, hosted on CharmVerse. While incomplete, they provide valuable context for the project's origins and intended direction.

## Overview

The Greenpill Network began planning a comprehensive toolkit to help communities implement regenerative practices. These documents capture early thinking, outlines, and prompt structures that informed later work.

## Key Sections

- **Outline Drafts**: Early structural plans for toolkit content
- **Prompt Templates**: Frameworks for content generation
- **Topic Lists**: Planned coverage areas
- **Discussion Notes**: Community input on priorities

## When to Reference

- Understanding the history of Greenpill toolkit efforts
- Looking for content ideas that were planned but not executed
- Checking alignment with original Greenpill vision
- Finding gaps that still need to be addressed

## Content Highlights

These docs show the evolution of thinking about what a regenerative toolkit should contain. Some planned content has been created elsewhere; some remains to be developed.

## Integration Notes

Use these documents for historical context and to identify content gaps. When creating new Regen Toolkit content, check if there were original plans or prompts that should inform the work.

## Status Notes
