# Graviton Introductory Course

The Graviton Introductory Course trains community members in conflict resolution and coordination practices essential for healthy DAO and community operations.

## Overview

Gravity DAO has developed a comprehensive training program for "Gravitons" - community members skilled in facilitating resolution and maintaining healthy group dynamics. The introductory course is the entry point to this training.

## Key Sections

- **Conflict Theory**: Understanding conflict in decentralized contexts
- **Resolution Practices**: Techniques for addressing disputes
- **Facilitation Skills**: Running productive conversations
- **Coordination Mechanisms**: Tools for group alignment
- **Community Health**: Maintaining sustainable communities

## When to Reference

- Establishing community guidelines and processes
- Training community facilitators
- Addressing conflicts in local initiatives
- Building sustainable community practices

## Content Highlights

The course goes beyond theory to provide practical skills. Gravitons who complete the training are equipped to handle real situations in their communities.

## Integration Notes

Any Regen Toolkit content about community building, governance, or long-term sustainability should reference Gravity's work. Conflict resolution is often overlooked but essential for lasting communities.

## Practical Application

Consider recommending that at least one member of any local initiative complete Graviton training to ensure the community has conflict resolution capacity.
