# Silvi Protocol Playbook

> **⚠️ Beta Status Warning**: Silvi Protocol is in early production stage with limited public documentation, unaudited smart contracts, and a small team. This playbook reflects current capabilities as of February 2026. Conduct additional due diligence before significant commitments.

---

## 1. Tool Overview

**Silvi Protocol** is a reforestation verification and coordination platform that combines traditional tree planting with Web3-enabled transparency. It operates a four-layer Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system designed to track reforestation projects from ground-level planting through satellite imagery analysis.

### Who Built It

Silvi was developed by a small team (2-10 employees) with support from the Celo blockchain ecosystem. The protocol emerged from the regenerative finance movement, with active campaigns across Kenya, Italy, Nigeria, and Brazil. The team maintains an active Discord community and Telegram group (83 members), though technical documentation and code repositories remain private.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Direct funding flow**: Investments go directly to Tree Stewards as rewards for verified plantings
- **Transparent verification**: 4-layer MRV provides auditable proof of tree survival and growth
- **Bioregional approach**: Campaigns organized around ecological bioregions rather than political boundaries
- **Community coordination**: Tools for project developers, funders, and tree stewards to collaborate

## 2. Maturity Assessment

**Overall Score: 5.1/10** (Beta/Early Production)

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Technical** | 5/10 | Functional MRV app operational; no public smart contracts or audits found |
| **Community** | 5/10 | 4+ active campaigns; small community (83 Telegram members) |
| **Organizational** | 5/10 | Small team, unclear legal structure, minimal Open Collective funding (€13) |
| **Ecosystem** | 5/10 | Web3 wallet integration functional; limited interoperability |

### What This Means

Silvi has crossed from concept to functional product with real-world deployments in Kenya, Italy, Nigeria, and Brazil. However, the lack of public whitepapers, smart contract verification, and security audits means it remains suitable for pioneering users but not yet ready for mainstream organizational adoption without additional due diligence.

---

## 3. Best For

### ✅ Small-to-Medium Reforestation Projects (1K–100K trees)
Silvi's direct funding model and ~$1/tree pricing make it ideal for projects that don't have the overhead for complex MRV infrastructure. The turnkey mobile verification system gets you operational quickly.

### ✅ Community-Led Initiatives
The Tree Steward model empowers local actors—farmers, community members, and individual planters—who receive direct rewards upon verification. Perfect for grassroots movements with engaged local communities.

### ✅ Projects Needing Quick MRV Deployment
If you lack existing monitoring infrastructure, Silvi's mobile-first approach provides immediate verification capability without building custom systems.

### ✅ Web3-Native Funders
Crypto-native donors benefit from blockchain-based transparency in fund flows, though specific chain integrations remain unclear.

### ✅ Bioregional Coordination
Designed for ecological rather than political boundaries—ideal for transboundary conservation initiatives like the Kakamega Forest or Mata Atlantica campaigns.

---

## 4. Not Ready For

### ❌ Large-Scale Corporate Procurement (>1M trees)
With a small team and limited scale validation, Silvi may face capacity constraints. Consider established MRV providers like Pachama or Sylvera for enterprise-scale projects.

### ❌ Regulatory Compliance (Verra/Gold Standard)
No evidence of compliance with major carbon credit standards. If you need compliance-grade credits, use Verra or Gold Standard certified projects instead.

### ❌ Institutional Investors Requiring Audits
No public security audits or financial transparency documentation. Risk-averse organizations should wait for audit completion or use audited alternatives.

### ❌ Projects Requiring Deep Integration
No public API or technical documentation limits integration possibilities. Contact the team directly for enterprise needs.

### ❌ Risk-Averse Organizations
Early-stage protocols carry persistence risk. If your organization cannot tolerate protocol failure, stick with established reforestation NGOs.

## 6. Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (2–4 weeks)

1. **Due Diligence**
   - Contact Silvi team via Discord for technical documentation
   - Review available MRV methodology details
   - Assess insurance and liability coverage
   - Verify legal entity structure

2. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Identify Tree Steward candidates
   - Confirm funding sources
   - Establish reporting cadence
   - Align on verification standards

### Phase 2: Project Setup (2–4 weeks)

1. **Platform Onboarding**
   - Create project in Silvi platform
   - Onboard Tree Stewards to mobile app
   - Configure verification workflows
   - Set up wallet connections

2. **Operational Preparation**
   - Source tree seedlings
   - Prepare planting sites
   - Train verifiers on mobile app
   - Establish baseline documentation

### Phase 3: Active Implementation

1. **Planting Phase**
   - Execute planting according to plan
   - Document each planting via mobile app (photo + geolocation)
   - Conduct drone surveys for validation
   - Process payments to Tree Stewards upon verification

2. **Monitoring Phase**
   - Regular verification checks (quarterly recommended)
   - Satellite imagery analysis for canopy coverage
   - Progress reporting to funders
   - Adaptive management based on survival rates

### Phase 4: Reporting & Scale

## 7. Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Can't find technical documentation** | Contact team directly via Discord; documentation is not public |
| **Unclear pricing structure** | Budget ~$1 USD per tree including verification; confirm with team |
| **Mobile app not working** | Ensure GPS and camera permissions enabled; contact Discord support |
| **Payment delays** | Verify wallet address is correct; check blockchain confirmation status |
| **Low verification rates** | Improve photo documentation training; ensure adequate lighting and angles |
| **Integration limitations** | No public API available—contact team for enterprise needs |

## 8. Alternatives

When Silvi isn't the right fit, consider these alternatives:

| Alternative | Best For | Key Difference |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Pachama** | Enterprise carbon credits | AI-powered satellite verification; compliance-grade |
| **Sylvera** | Carbon credit ratings | Independent ratings for existing projects; not planting coordination |
| **Regen Network** | On-chain ecological credits | Open-source; blockchain-native MRV; steeper learning curve |
| **Moss.Earth** | Brazilian reforestation | Amazon-specific; tokenized carbon credits |
| **Traditional NGOs** | Risk-averse funders | Established track record; no Web3 complexity |

## 9. Case Studies

### Kenya: Kakamega Forest Agroforestry
**Scale**: Thousands of farmers transitioning to agroforestry
**Approach**: Mobile verification for smallholder farmers combining conservation with agricultural productivity
**Outcome**: Demonstrates scalability to thousands of participants in East Africa

### Italy: Refai Sicilia
**Location**: Sicily bioregion
**Price**: $1 USD per tree
**Approach**: "Tradition, technology, and the simple art of tree planting"
**Highlight**: Part of $100k Bioregional Round 2025 matching fund campaign

### Nigeria: Grassroots Movement
**Approach**: Coordinated grassroots combining education, reforestation, and community building
**Components**: Education programs, tree planting, community coordination
**Significance**: African expansion beyond Kenya

### Brazil: Mata Atlantica Restoration
**Focus**: Restoring Brazil's Atlantic Forest (85% already lost)
**Priority**: Native species for biodiversity
**Recognition**: High-profile biome with international visibility

## Summary

Silvi Protocol offers an accessible entry point into Web3-enabled reforestation with its $1/tree pricing and 4-layer MRV system. It's best suited for small-to-medium projects (1K–100K trees) with engaged local communities and funders comfortable with beta-stage technology.

**Bottom Line**: Start with a pilot project to test the platform before scaling. The direct-to-steward funding model and mobile verification are genuine innovations, but the lack of audits and public documentation means proceed with appropriate caution.
