# Setting Up Your First Wallet

A crypto wallet works like a digital mailbox that only you can open. Your wallet has a unique address where people send you digital assets, just like your home mailbox has an address for letters.

Your wallet provides access to the entire Web3 ecosystem — storing cryptocurrencies, interacting with blockchain applications, and participating in regenerative finance projects.

## Choosing Your First Wallet

Choose between mobile and desktop wallets based on your needs.

**Mobile wallets** travel with you everywhere, perfect for quick transactions and checking balances on the go. Popular options include [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) and [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me). These work best for simple transactions and everyday use.

**Desktop wallets** offer more screen space and easier navigation for complex interactions. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) browser extension leads this category, providing seamless integration with Web3 applications through your computer browser.

> 💡 **Going Deeper:** Browser extension wallets like MetaMask actually run as plugins in your web browser, creating a bridge between traditional websites and blockchain networks. They inject Web3 functionality directly into your browsing experience.

## Step-by-Step Wallet Creation

Follow these exact steps to create your first wallet safely:

### 1. Download from Official Sources

Visit the official app store (iOS/Android) or official website for your chosen wallet. Never download wallets from third-party sites or unofficial links.

### 2. Choose "Create New Wallet"

Select the "Create a Wallet" option. Avoid importing or restoring unless you already own a wallet.

### 3. Set a Strong Password

Set a strong password for your wallet. This password protects access to your wallet on your device.

### 4. Record Your Seed Phrase (Critical Step)

Your wallet will display a series of words in a specific order. This seed phrase acts like a master key that can restore your entire wallet.

**Write these words down exactly as shown:**
- Use pen and paper (never digital screenshots)
- Write them in the exact order displayed
- Double-check each word for accuracy
- Store in a secure, offline location

### 5. Verify Your Seed Phrase

Complete any verification steps your wallet requires to confirm you recorded your seed phrase correctly.

> 🔧 **For Practitioners:** Consider creating multiple physical copies of your seed phrase and storing them in different secure locations like a home safe and safety deposit box. Metal backup solutions exist for long-term storage that resists fire and water damage.

## Common Setup Mistakes to Avoid

These mistakes can lead to permanent loss of funds:

**Never store your seed phrase digitally.** This includes email, cloud storage, photos, or password managers.

**Never share your seed phrase with anyone.** Legitimate companies will never ask for your seed phrase.

**Don't skip the backup verification.** Test that you can restore your wallet using your seed phrase before storing significant assets.

**Avoid using public computers for wallet setup.** Use your personal device in a secure location to prevent keyloggers or screen recording.

## Post-Setup Security Steps

Once your wallet exists, implement these security practices:

**Update your wallet software regularly** to receive security patches and new features.

**Enable two-factor authentication** if your wallet offers this option for additional login protection.

**Start with small amounts.** Send a tiny test transaction to verify everything works before transferring larger sums.

**Learn about transaction fees** (called "gas" on Ethereum) before making your first transaction to avoid surprises.

> 💡 **Going Deeper:** Transaction fees fluctuate based on network congestion. Most wallets show estimated fees before you confirm transactions.

## Understanding Your Wallet Address

Your wallet automatically generates a unique address that looks like a long string of letters and numbers. Share this address to receive payments, but keep your seed phrase private.

Your address is like your home address — anyone can know it to send you mail. Your seed phrase is like your house keys — only you should have them.

## Network Selection

Most wallets support multiple blockchain networks. Ethereum serves as the main network, while Layer 2 networks like [Base](https://base.org) offer lower transaction fees.

Your wallet can switch between networks. Assets exist separately on each network, like having accounts at different banks.

> 🔧 **For Practitioners:** Start with Ethereum mainnet for maximum compatibility, then explore Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, or Polygon as you become comfortable with cross-network asset management.

## Action Items / Next Steps

1. **Choose your wallet type** based on your primary use case (mobile for convenience, desktop for Web3 app interaction)
2. **Download and set up your wallet** following the five-step process above
3. **Create and secure your seed phrase backup** before adding any assets
4. **Send yourself a test transaction** using a small amount to verify everything works
5. **Explore network switching** to understand how different blockchains connect to your wallet
