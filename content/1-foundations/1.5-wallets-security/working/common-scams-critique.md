## Critique Questions

### What confused me?
- Some terms like "liquidity locked" and "token economics" could use simpler explanations
- "Pig butchering" is a jarring term - might want to explain the metaphor briefly

### What's still unclear?
- How do I actually set up a hardware wallet? (Article mentions them but doesn't explain)
- The recovery process section is good but feels a bit overwhelming

### What's missing?
- A simple "start here" checklist for absolute beginners
- More community-focused angles (how to help my garden club stay safe)

### Did this respect my time?
- ✅ Yes - clear sections, good use of bold text, practical tips
- ✅ The garden/nature analogies work well for my background
- ✅ The "Your shield" and "Your protection" callouts are helpful
- ✅ I feel empowered, not scared

## Verdict: SHIP IT ✅

**Notes:**
- The article balances caution with encouragement well
- Jargon is mostly well-explained
- The nature analogies connect with my background
- Action items are clear and practical
- Would benefit from a brief "Getting Started" box in a future revision

**Suggested minor improvements (optional):**
- Add quick-start tip: "Start with small amounts even when you're sure"
- Consider a simple glossary callout box for terms like "seed phrase"
