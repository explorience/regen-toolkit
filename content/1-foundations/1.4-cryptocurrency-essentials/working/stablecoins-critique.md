## Critique Questions

### What confused me?

Nothing major. The three-category framework (fiat-backed, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic) is clear. The table at the end makes quick reference easy.

**Minor confusion:** The "Try This" section says "set up a wallet" as step 1—but Alex already has multiple wallets. Maybe reframe as "if you don't have a wallet" or skip to the more advanced stuff.

### What's still unclear?

Not much. The trade-offs between categories are well explained. The risks (censorship, smart contracts, governance) are called out honestly.

**Could be clearer:** How exactly does overcollateralization work mechanically? I understood it from context, but a quick example (deposit $200 ETH → borrow $100 DAI) would help.

### What's missing?

1. **Real-world ReFi integration:** The article mentions Glo Dollar (good!), but doesn't dive into how stablecoins specifically power regenerative finance. For a degen looking to "do meaningful things," I'd want more on: "Here's how stablecoins actually fund regeneration."

2. **Audit transparency comparison:** You mention USDC gets audited, USDT doesn't. But what's the actual current state? How do I verify this myself?

3. **Smart contract audit info:** You say "only use audited protocols" for algorithmic stablecoins—but how do I find those audits? What does a "good" audit look like?

### Did this respect my time?

Yes. ~850 words, scannable structure, practical tone. No fluff. Direct language.

**Pacing:** Good. Hook in first sentence, categories clear, action items at end.

## Verdict

**SHIP IT** ✅

**With minor suggestions:**
- Add brief example of overcollateralization mechanics (optional)
- Consider adding 1-2 sentences on stablecoins in ReFi context beyond Glo Dollar (optional)
- "Try This" could note "if you don't already have a wallet" for the first step

**Rating:** 8.5/10 - Solid foundation, appropriate for Alex's technical level, honest about risks. The Glo Dollar mention shows ReFi awareness. Could go deeper on regenerative use cases, but that's a "nice to have" not a blocker.
