## Key Concepts (Source-Cited)

### What Are Stablecoins?
- Stablecoins are the blockchain equivalent of fiat currency, like the dollar or euro. [Source P]
- Stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens that allow DeFi users to quickly move between fiat value and crypto value while staying on the blockchain. [Source P]
- Stablecoins have become a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, reaching over $140 billion USD in supply value at their 2022 peak. [Source P]
- Stablecoins settled over $7 trillion in transaction value in 2022 — that's ~0.3% of global USD settlement in 2022. [Source P]

### Why Hold Stablecoins?
- **Stability:** Holding stablecoins in your self-custody wallet is like holding fiat currency, but on the blockchain. When holding a stablecoin like USDC, you can expect it to maintain 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar while the prices of assets like ether and bitcoin fluctuate. [Source P]
- **Flexibility:** Because this pegged value exists as an ERC-20 token on the blockchain, it's easy to move between fiat value and crypto value. [Source P]
- **Access:** Stablecoins provide access to a range of decentralized financial services, like permissionless borrowing or lending to earn interest. [Source P]
- **Security:** Cryptography makes it extremely difficult for attackers to capture or forge transactions. [Source P]

### Three Categories of Stablecoins

#### 1. Fiat-backed Stablecoins
- 1:1 collateralized by real-world fiat reserves. [Source P]
- Notable examples: Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). [Source P]
- Revenue generation: investing reserves in short-term US Treasuries, collecting transaction fees, offering lending services. [Source P]
- **Innovation - Glo Dollar:** The Glo Foundation created USDGLO, a US dollar-backed stablecoin that directs interest earned from reserves towards basic income programs for people in extreme poverty. [Source P]
- **Considerations:**
  - Collateral Audits: Holders need assurance that stablecoin tokens are matched one-to-one by fiat reserves. USDC regularly undergoes independent audits; USDT has historically made it difficult to know the total value of their locked assets. [Source P]
  - Censorship Risk: Both USDC and USDT have freeze functions that can lock on-chain holdings in cases of disagreeable activity, even for non-custodial wallets. [Source P]

#### 2. Crypto-collateralized Stablecoins
- Overcollateralized by crypto deposits into DeFi protocols (sometimes up to 200%). [Source P]
- All collateralized assets are viewable on-chain, giving users 24/7 access to the real composition. [Source P]
- Notable example: MakerDAO's Dai (DAI). [Source P]
- DAI is backed by BTC, ETH, stablecoins, real world assets, and several other components. [Source P]
- **Considerations:**
  - Collateral Valuation: To mitigate risks of diverse assets, DAI is overcollateralized. Even if ETH price crashes by 20%, DAI would still have enough collateral to cover tokens. [Source P]
  - Counterparty Risk: Reliance on multiple asset classes means higher chance one asset will experience difficulty. [Source P]
  - Governance Risk: Managed by decentralized governance voters; risks of human error or governance capture. [Source P]

#### 3. Algorithmic Stablecoins
- Fixed supply/demand algorithms that maintain price stability. [Source P]
- Algorithm reduces tokens in circulation when price falls below peg, injects new tokens when price surpasses peg. [Source P]
- Both the algorithm and smart contracts are public, meaning anyone can audit or clone. [Source P]
- Nearly eliminate counterparty risk since they have fewest external dependencies. [Source P]
- Notable examples: Liquity (LUSD) and Frax (FRAX). [Source P]
- **Considerations:**
  - Dynamic Holdings: Token supply adjustments mean your number of tokens will fluctuate. Total value remains constant, but this can confuse new users. [Source P]
  - Highly Technical: You need to understand the technology to build confidence. [Source P]
  - Emergent Tech Risk: Unknown smart contract risks could be present. Only use algorithmic stablecoins with several smart contract audits. [Source P]

### Choosing a Stablecoin
- Depends on your needs, values, and risk tolerance. [Source P]
- **Fiat-backed:** Values: Conventionality, institutional trust. Risks: Opaque collateral backing, ability for provider to freeze funds. [Source P]
- **Crypto-collateralized:** Values: Diversification, transparency, progression. Risks: Crypto market volatility, dependence on other assets. [Source P]
- **Algorithmic:** Values: Self-sovereignty, transparency, progression. Risks: Higher risk of smart contract bugs. [Source P]

### Where to Buy Stablecoins
- Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) offer popular fiat-backed stablecoins. [Source P]
- Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) or wallet on-ramp services like MetaMask Buy for crypto-collateralized and algorithmic tokens. [Source P]

### Earning Interest on Stablecoins
- Some CEXs offer yield by holding stablecoins, funded by platform profits. [Source]
- DeFi lending platforms connect lenders and borrowers, managing risk through on-chain collateral and smart contracts. [Source P]
- Stablecoin lenders can earn annual returns far higher than traditional banking — but where there's reward, there's risk. [Source P]
- Platforms to research: Aave.com, Curve.fi [Source P]

### What Happens If a Stablecoin Loses Its Peg?
- Price can shift slightly (usually around +/- 2%) in peak network hours. This effect is usually temporary, with prices stabilized by traders arbitrage. [Source P]
- Cases where stablecoins lose peg beyond safe ranges: USDC (March 2023 - temporary), Terra (May 2022 - permanent failure). [Source P]
- Some fiat-backed issuers like USDC offer 1:1 redemption from stablecoin to fiat through their website. [Source P]

## Summary for Writer
The primary source (Bankless Academy) provides comprehensive coverage of stablecoin fundamentals, categories, considerations, and use cases. For Alex (Curious Degen), focus on technical accuracy, risk considerations, and practical DeFi integration. Emphasize the three categories with their trade-offs. Include the Glo Dollar innovation as it's particularly relevant to regenerative finance values.
