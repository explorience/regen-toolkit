# What is Blockchain?

Have you ever tried to keep track of who owes what in a community garden project? By harvest time, nobody can remember who promised what. Now imagine if every single person in the garden had their own notebook, and every week everyone compared notes before deciding what happened. That's a blockchain.

## A Shared Notebook for the Village

A blockchain is a shared digital notebook that many people keep copies of.

Once, one person—let's call him LedgerMan—was in charge of writing down every trade and promise. The problem? He could make mistakes, lose the notebook, or change the records. Everyone had to trust him completely.

Then the villagers said: "What if ALL of us keep a notebook?"

Now when Maria trades tomatoes with Jamal, they announce it to everyone. Each family writes it down. At the end of the week, they compare notes. If most families agree, that's the official record.

This is "distributed ledger technology"—instead of one server, everyone holds a copy. These computers are called **nodes**.

## Blocks in the Chain

Each "page" in our village notebook is called a **block**—a collection of records, like one week's worth of garden trades.

Here's the clever part: each block contains a "cryptographic hash" of the previous block. Think of it like a unique fingerprint. If someone tries to change an old record, the fingerprint breaks and everyone knows.

This is why blockchains are **immutable**—they can't be changed. Once written, it's there forever. To alter history, you'd have to convince most families to all change their records at once. Practically impossible.

## Trust Without Trust

"Trustless" sounds negative—but it actually means you don't HAVE to trust any single person. Everyone watches everyone else.

The system solves the "double-spending problem" without a middleman. In our garden, that would be Maria promising her tomato seedlings to both Jamal AND Carlos. Everyone would catch the lie because they all have their own copy of the notebook.

Anyone can check the records anytime. No asking permission.

## Real-World Examples

- **Walmart** tracks food safety with blockchain—tracing contamination back to its source while keeping supplier pricing private
- **Hyperledger** is a private blockchain businesses use to track supply chains between partners
- **Bitcoin**—the first and most well-known public blockchain
- **Ethereum**—introduced "smart contracts," or agreements that automatically execute when conditions are met

## Why Does This Matter for Regenerative Communities?

If we can track garden trades without trusting one person, can we track carbon credits? Verify regenerative farming practices? Create community currencies without banks?

The technology lets regenerative communities build trust with each other—and the wider world—without expensive middlemen or complicated paperwork.

## Conclusion

Blockchain is a shared, unchangeable notebook that many people keep copies of. It lets people make agreements without trusting one authority. Started with digital money, but it's growing into tools that help communities organize, trade, and verify claims about regeneration.
