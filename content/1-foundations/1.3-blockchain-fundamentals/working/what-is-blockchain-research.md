## Key Concepts

### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a "distributed and immutable digital ledger that is responsible for recording transactions and tracking the movement of digital assets on its network." [Source P]

A blockchain is "a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes." [Source S]

"Blockchain networks provide the foundations for cryptocurrency, allowing peer-to-peer transactions." [Source P]

### Blocks

"Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree." [Source S]

"Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data." [Source S]

### The Chain

"The linked blocks form a chain." [Source S]

"This specific data structure ensures that it is impossible to alter information once included in the blockchain." [Source P]

### Distributed Ledger Technology

"Instead of hosting its information on a single centralized server, a blockchain distributes its ledger to each and every computer in the system. These computers are called nodes and they are responsible for storing, sharing, and recording information and the transfer of digital assets." [Source P]

This is "the basis of 'distributed ledger' technology, and it's the only way in which blockchains can store information securely." [Source P]

## Direct Quotes Worth Including

> "A blockchain is an immutable digital ledger that records every single transaction ever made." [Source P]

> "The trustless capabilities of blockchain technology sparked off an entire DeFi industry that could challenge traditional banking." [Source P]

> "Blockchain technology solves the double-spending problem without involving a centralized entity to verify transactions." [Source P]

> "This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively." [Source S]

> "Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes." [Source S]

## Examples/Case Studies Maya Would Understand

### The Village Story Analogy

A helpful way to understand blockchain is through this village example:

"Instead of only one of us holding on to a ledger, why don't ALL of us keep a ledger?"

In this story, a village originally had one person (LedgerMan) tracking all promises/trades. This person became corrupt, so the villagers decided instead to give every family their own copy of the ledger. They would meet regularly to compare notes and reach "consensus" on which transactions were valid. If most ledgers agreed on a transaction, it became the official record.

This village system "was able to remove the need for a middle-man" and "create a trustless system" where no single person had control. [Source S]

### Real-World Examples

- **Bitcoin Network** - The first and most well-known public blockchain [Source P]
- **Ethereum** - Introduced "smart contracts" enabling programmable applications [Source P]
- **Hyperledger** - A private blockchain used for supply chain tracking, such as keeping shipping information private [Source P]
- **Walmart** - Uses hybrid blockchain to track food safety publicly while keeping supplier pricing confidential [Source S]

## Gaps: What Sources DON'T Cover

The sources focus primarily on financial applications and technical explanations. They do NOT cover:

1. **Environmental impact** - Energy consumption of blockchain networks (particularly proof-of-work systems like early Bitcoin) is not addressed in these sources
2. **Regenerative applications** - No discussion of how blockchain could be used for environmental tracking, carbon credits, or regenerative agriculture
3. **Critiques or drawbacks** - Limited coverage of downsides or risks
4. **Practical setup** - No guidance on how a beginner would actually use or interact with a blockchain
5. **Layer 2 solutions detail** - Only brief mentions, no deep explanation of scaling solutions

## Notes for Writer

- The target audience (Maya) has no tech/crypto background - avoid jargon
- The village analogy is particularly accessible for someone from a permaculture/agrarian background
- Emphasize the "trustless" aspect - it means you don't HAVE to trust any single person/institution, not that you can't trust the system
- Distinguish between blockchain (the technology) and cryptocurrency (applications that use the technology)
