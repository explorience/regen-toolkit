## Claim-by-Claim Analysis

### ✅ Verified Claims (with source citation)

| # | Claim | Source |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | "A blockchain is a 'distributed and immutable digital ledger that is responsible for recording transactions and tracking the movement of digital assets on its network'" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 2 | "Instead of hosting information on one centralized server, a blockchain distributes its ledger to each and every computer in the system. These computers are called nodes" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 3 | "Each block holds batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 4 | "Each block also contains something called a 'cryptographic hash' of the previous block" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 5 | "This specific data structure ensures that it is impossible to alter information once included in the blockchain" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 6 | "Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 7 | "The village system was able to remove the need for a middle-man" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 8 | "Create a trustless system" where no single person had control | Source S - Mango Research |
| 9 | "Blockchain technology solves the double-spending problem without involving a centralized entity to verify transactions" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 10 | "This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 11 | "Walmart uses blockchain to track food safety" | Source S - Mango Research |
| 12 | "Hyperledger is a private blockchain used by businesses to track supply chains" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 13 | "Bitcoin, the first and most well-known public blockchain" | Source P - Bankless Academy |
| 14 | "Ethereum introduced 'smart contracts' enabling programmable applications" | Source P - Bankless Academy |

### ⚠️ Unverified Claims (not in sources - original analogies)

| # | Claim | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Village notebook analogy with "LedgerMan" | Original analogy created by writer, not in sources. Concept is consistent with sources but specific characters/details are invented. |
| 2 | "If most families had the same record, that became the official truth" - consensus mechanism detail | Original explanation, not directly in sources. Concept aligns with distributed ledger principles. |
| 3 | The detail about Walmart keeping "supplier pricing confidential" while being publicly traceable | Source S mentions Walmart uses hybrid blockchain for food safety but doesn't explicitly mention supplier pricing confidentiality |

### ❌ Incorrect Claims (contradicts sources)

*None found.*

---

### 🔍 Needs External Verification

| # | Claim | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | "The trustless capabilities of blockchain technology sparked off an entire DeFi industry that could challenge traditional banking" | Source P mentions this quote but it's an opinion/analysis claim. The DeFi industry exists, but "could challenge traditional banking" is forward-looking speculation rather than established fact. |

## Additional Notes

### Source Quality
- Both sources (Bankless Academy and Mango Research) are credible educational sources
- Direct quotes are accurately transcribed
- Technical definitions align between both sources

### Minor Suggestions
1. The "village notebook" analogy is excellent for the target audience (Maya/permaculture teacher) - while not in sources, it's an effective pedagogical tool that accurately represents the concepts
2. The Walmart claim could be strengthened by noting it's a "hybrid blockchain" (mentioned in research) rather than purely public or private

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** - The article passes the fact-check gate. All major claims are verified against the sources, and any unverified claims are either original analogies (which are accurate representations of the concepts) or minor elaborations that don't contradict the sources.

No revision needed.
