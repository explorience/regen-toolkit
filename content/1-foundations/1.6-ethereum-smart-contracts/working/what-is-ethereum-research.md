## 1-Pargraph Test

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that lets anyone build and run applications without relying on a central authority. Think of it like a shared digital ledger that thousands of computers around the world maintain together—no single person or company controls it. Unlike traditional apps that run on company servers, Ethereum's applications (called "smart contracts") run automatically when their conditions are met, like a vending machine that dispenses without a human cashier. The native currency, Ether (ETH), fuels these operations and can also be used for peer-to-peer payments. For regens interested in tools like Gitcoin, clr.fund, or impact DAOs, Ethereum is the foundational infrastructure making these possible.
