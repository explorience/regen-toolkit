### Reading as Maya

**Who is Maya?**
- Permaculture teacher, community garden organizer

- Goals: "Can this web3 stuff help my community?"
- Fears: Scams, looking stupid, wasting time
- Language: No jargon, explain everything, nature/community analogies

## Critique Questions

### 1. What confused me?

**Nothing confused me.** The article explained terms clearly:
- "DAO" defined in the Quick Reference table
- "ReFi" defined on first use AND in glossary
- "Token" explained simply

The hammer analogy (Paragraph 1) was perfect for someone like me who doesn't think about technology first.

### 2. What's still unclear?

Honestly? **Not much.** The article answered my main question: "Why should I care?"

The only thing I'd want to know more about is: *How do I actually try this without risking money?* The "Try This" section is good, but maybe one could mention you can explore without buying anything.

---

### 3. What's missing?

The article covers the key reasons well:
- ✅ Funding (community treasuries, ReFi)
- ✅ Decision-making (DAOs)
- ✅ Ownership (self-custody)

One small gap: **Examples of real regen projects.** The Greenpill story is mentioned, but maybe one specific example like "a community garden using quadratic funding" would hit home.

### 4. Did this respect my time?

**Yes.** 
- ~970 words (quick read)
- Clear sections I can scan
- Quick Reference table at the end if I forget terms
- "Try This" section gives me next steps, not just information

---

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict: SHIP IT ✅**

This article works for Maya because:
- ✅ No unexplained jargon
- ✅ Community-focused framing ("Can this help my community?")
- ✅ Honest about limitations (scams, complexity)
- ✅ Practical next steps
- ✅ Respects I don't want to learn tech for tech's sake

The tone is friendly without being condescending. It doesn't assume I know what a blockchain is. It meets me where I am.

### Minor Suggestions (Optional)

1. Could add: "You don't need to buy anything to explore" - addresses the fear of scams/losing money
2. Maybe bold the website URLs for easier scanning

**These are nice-to-haves, not blockers.**
