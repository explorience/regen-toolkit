## Detailed Fact-Check

### Centralized Systems Section

| # | Claim | Status | Source |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | "A centralized system is one where a single authority controls everything. In computing terms, this means one main server handles all the data and decisions." | ✅ Verified | Research defines centralized systems as "computing architectures where all or most of the processing and data storage is done on a single central server" with "Single point of control" [Source S] |
| 2 | "Traditional banks: When you put money in a commercial bank, they hold it for you. 'If your bank can freeze your life savings at any time… do you truly own your money?'" | ✅ Verified | Direct quote from Bankless Academy [Source P] |
| 3 | "In the US and Canada, food production is concentrated within a small number of large farms and processing plants." | ✅ Verified | Research: "In large developed countries like the USA and Canada, food production is concentrated within a small number of large farms and plants" [Source S] |
| 4 | "One company might control a huge portion of the meat supply—as we saw when COVID-19 shut down just five major meat processing plants, and over 80% of beef production was disrupted." | ✅ Verified | Research: "When five major meat packing and processing plants in the US shut their doors during COVID-19 outbreaks, over 80% of the beef and 60% of the pork production in the US were disrupted" [Source S] |
| 5 | "Centralized systems have some real strengths. They're easier to manage because there's one clear authority." | ✅ Verified | Research: "Easier to manage and maintain since there is one primary location for administration" [Source S] |
| 6 | "Single point of failure. If that one central authority goes down, everything stops." | ✅ Verified | Research: "if the central server fails, the entire system can become inoperative" [Source S] |

### Decentralized Systems Section

| # | Claim | Status | Source |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 7 | "Decentralized systems spread control across many independent parts. No single authority can shut everything down." | ✅ Verified | Research: "multiple nodes, often spread across different locations, share control and processing power without a single central authority" [Source S] |
| 8 | "Decentralization means the dispersal of authority throughout the organisation..." | ✅ Verified | Direct quote from academic sources [Source S] |
| 9 | "Community gardens and food cooperatives: These empower residents to shape their food environments and build more resilient food systems." | ✅ Verified | Research: "Community gardens, food policy councils, and local food cooperatives empower residents to shape their food environments and build more resilient food systems" [Source S] |
| 10 | "Victory Gardens: During World War II, the U.S. government encouraged citizens to grow their own food in victory gardens to promote self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on the centralized food system." | ✅ Verified | Research: "During World War II, the U.S. government encouraged citizens to cultivate their own food in victory gardens...promote self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on the centralized food system" [Source S] |
| 11 | "Bitcoin: This digital currency operates 'peer-to-peer...automated using blockchain technology, it removes need for institutions to facilitate storage or transactions. Advocates call it 'a set of rules with no rulers.'" | ✅ Verified | Direct quote from Bankless Academy: "Bitcoin is peer-to-peer: It connects people directly to each other. Automated using blockchain technology, it removes need for institutions...Advocates call it 'a set of rules with no rulers.'" [Source P] |
| 12 | "If one node fails, the system can continue to function with the remaining nodes." | ✅ Verified | Research: "Enhanced fault tolerance - if one node fails, the system can continue to function with the remaining nodes" [Source S] |

### Why Does This Matter for Permaculture?

| # | Claim | Status | Source |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 13 | "A 2022 study found that decentralization of food systems improves resilience in responding to energy and water disruptions." | ✅ Verified | Research: "A 2022 study found that decentralization of food systems improves resilience in responding to energy and water disruptions" [Source S] |
| 14 | "However, it's not always simple. The same research found that responding to labor shortages actually favors more centralized systems." | ✅ Verified | Research: "achieving more resilient food systems in responding to labor shortage supports a push towards more centralized systems" [Source S] |

### The Spectrum: It's Not All or Nothing

| # | Claim | Status | Source |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 15 | "Centralized systems rely on a single point of control, providing simplicity but risking a single point of failure. Decentralized systems distribute control among multiple nodes, enhancing fault tolerance and scalability." | ✅ Verified | Direct quote from academic sources [Source S] |

### The Bigger Picture

| # | Claim | Status | Source |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 16 | "Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, 'thought that money was too important to be controlled by just a few people. He wanted to create a type of money that could be fair and reliable for everyone.'" | ✅ Verified | Direct quote from Bankless Academy [Source P] |
