## Critique as Jordan

### ✅ What Works

1. **Hook connects** - "You've heard the word since ETH Denver" - immediately relates to Jordan's experience
2. **Assumes web3 basics** - No explaining what Snapshot or multi-sig is - Jordan knows this
3. **Practical focus** - The "Three Pillars" and "Practical Patterns" give Jordan things they can actually use
4. **Addresses fears** - Mentions "survive contributor turnover" which addresses burning out
5. **Actionable "Try This"** - Three concrete steps Jordan can start this week
6. **Right length** - ~900 words respects Jordan's time

### ? What Might Confuse

1. **"fork"** - Mentioned but not explained. Jordan probably knows, but a quick parenthetical wouldn't hurt. (Minor)
2. **Related links** - Three placeholder links at the end that don't exist yet. These should either be removed or replaced with real links.

### What's Missing

1. **Nothing critical** - Covers the core concept well for Jordan's needs
