## Claims Needing Note ⚠️

| Claim | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Quadratic voting prevents whale dominance | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED IN SOURCES | General knowledge in ReFi space, widely used but not specifically in cited sources |
| Contributor circles / Coordinape | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED IN SOURCES | Referenced as "see Coordinape" - user would need to consult Coordinape docs |

---

## Citations Format Issue ⚠️

The draft uses "[Source: Starknet]", "[Source: AWS]" but the SKILL.md specifies format "[Source A]", "[Source D]". Need to update citations to match source codes:

- Source A = ReFi DAO Local ReFi Toolkit
- Source D = 1Hive Wiki  
- Source S = Original/Web Research (Starknet, AWS are from S)

## Recommended Fixes

1. Update citations to use "[Source A]", "[Source D]", "[Source S]" format per SKILL.md
2. The "Quadratic voting" and "Contributed circles" claims are widely accepted practices in the ReFi space but should be cited to specific documentation if possible - for now, acceptable for Jordan (on-chain regen) audience who knows this
