## Key Concepts (Source-Cited)

### Definition of Decentralization
- **Decentralization** = distribution of authority and control across a network of participants [Source S]
- No single entity has unilateral control over data or decision-making
- Eliminates reliance on central authority like a bank or government [Source S]
- Cryptocurrencies are regulated by their programming code and community, not central banks [Source S]

### Decentralization in DAO/Governance Context
- **Decentralized governance** = procedures through which a platform's disintermediated, equitable management is carried out for blockchain networks and dApps [Source S]
- Many DAOs have components at different stages of decentralization:
  - Oracles may be partly decentralized
  - Smart contracts might be fully decentralized or centralized
  - Governance processes for adjusting parameters are often community-driven and decentralized [Source S]

### 1Hive's Approach to Decentralization (Source D)
From 1Hive's mission and values:
- **Free:** Systems that expand personal and collective autonomy
  - Voluntary participation, self-governance, freedom to fork/exit/build alternatives
- **Open:** Build in public, with transparency and accessibility
  - Knowledge, tools, and governance processes accessible to anyone who wants to participate
- 1Hive believes "open and decentralized systems are essential for aligning our social, technological, and economic institutions with the public good" [Source D]

### Local ReFi Toolkit's View (Source A)
- ReFi DAO Local ReFi Toolkit emphasizes **community-led regional implementations** (Local ReFi Nodes)
- Focus on **Ethereum Localism** - bridging global decentralized infrastructure with local community needs
- **Key principle:** Decentralization enables communities to build regenerative economic systems without gatekeeping

## Direct Quotes Worth Including

1. "Decentralization in blockchain refers to the distribution of authority and control across a network of participants. In this model, no single entity has unilateral control over data or decision-making." - Starknet

2. "We believe that open and decentralized systems are essential for aligning our social, technological, and economic institutions with the public good." - 1Hive

3. "A free future is one where individuals can make meaningful choices — about how they live, work, and contribute — without coercion or gatekeeping. We value voluntary participation, self-governance, and the freedom to fork, exit, or build alternatives." - 1Hive

## Examples/Case Studies

1. **1Hive DAO** - Community of creators building Honey (digital currency) with open governance
2. **Local ReFi Nodes** - Community-led regional implementations documented in ReFi DAO toolkit
3. **Greenpill Network** - Decentralized network of chapters with Group State documentation practices

## Key Principles for On-Chain Regen (Jordan's Context)

Based on sources, decentralization for regen practitioners means:
1. **No gatekeeping** - Anyone can participate in governance
2. **Transparency** - All processes open and accessible
3. **Voluntary participation** - Self-governance, exit rights
4. **Community coordination** - Local nodes with global coordination
5. **Regenerative alignment** - Economic systems designed for collective well-being

## Gaps: What Sources DON'T Cover

- Specific technical implementation details of decentralization (smart contract architecture)
- Comparison of different decentralization models (DAOs vs traditional corporations)
- Quantitative metrics for measuring decentralization
- Detailed governance playbooks for starting local chapters (covered elsewhere in toolkit)
