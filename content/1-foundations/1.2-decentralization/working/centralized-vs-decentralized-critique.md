# Critique: Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems
## Persona: 🌱 Maya (Grounded Regen)

## What confused me?

1. **The jump from gardens to Bitcoin felt jarring.** One paragraph I'm reading about community gardens and food co-ops, the next I'm suddenly in Bitcoin territory. It felt like the article didn't trust its own gardening examples—like they weren't "serious" enough, so it reached for crypto to sound credible.

2. **"Single point of failure"** — I get the concept intuitively but the term itself feels like jargon. Could say "if one thing breaks, everything stops" instead.

3. **The quote definition of decentralization** — *"decentralization means spreading authority throughout an organization—delegating to the lowest levels all authority except what must be held centrally."* — This is wordy and circular. I had to read it twice.

## What's still unclear?

1. **What actually IS blockchain?** It's mentioned twice but never explained. I know it's related to crypto, but I don't know what it does or why I should care.

2. **The Bitcoin analogy feels forced.** "Advocates call it 'a set of rules with no rulers'" — this sounds cool but I don't understand what it means for my community garden. It feels like the article is trying to make me care about crypto by wrapping it in gardening language.

3. **What does "explore local currency" actually look like?** The Try This section mentions this but gives no examples. How do I actually start? What would I do tomorrow?

4. **The academic reference is vague.** It says "Academic sources on centralized and distributed systems" without specifics. And the PMC article reference doesn't tell me what to search for or why it matters.

## What's missing?

1. **More concrete, non-crypto examples.** I loved the Victory Gardens and food co-op examples—they're real, historical, and inspiring. More of these please! What about tool libraries? Seed saver networks? Community-supported agriculture (CSA)?

2. **The permaculture ethics connection.** The article mentions permaculture in the header but doesn't explicitly connect to earth care, people care, and fair share. How does decentralization actually SUPPORT these ethics?

3. **Honest downsides of decentralization.** The article paints decentralization as almost purely good. But isn't it harder to coordinate? Doesn't it sometimes mean slower decisions? What about when no one takes responsibility? A more balanced view would feel more trustworthy.

4. **Actionable details for the "Try This" section:**
   - "Map Your Food Network" — how do I actually do this? A spreadsheet? A drawing?
   - "Start a Seed Swap" — give me a simple format, where to advertise, what to swap
   - "Practice Delegation" — examples of what decisions to pass down

5. **A bridge for non-tech readers.** Something like: "If any of this tech talk feels unfamiliar, don't worry—the principles apply to your garden whether or not you ever touch a computer."

## Did this respect my time?

**Mostly yes.** The article is the right length and the conversational tone is friendly. I appreciated:
- The "hybrid systems" section acknowledging it's not all-or-nothing
- The Try This activities being practical
- The clear section headings that let me skim

**But:** The crypto detour added length without adding value for someone like me. I kept waiting for the article to "land" in my world, and when it did (the community garden parts), those sections were great. The tech stuff felt like it was from a different article that got stitched on.

## Final verdict: **NEEDS WORK**

The core content is good—the gardening and food system examples are solid, the principles are relevant, and the Try This activities are useful. But the article tries to do two things at once (explain decentralization for gardeners AND introduce crypto concepts), and it doesn't fully succeed at either.

**Specific fixes needed:**
1. Cut or de-emphasize the Bitcoin/blockchain content, or move it to a separate article
2. Add more non-crypto examples (tool libraries, CSAs, seed saver networks)
3. Explain any tech term before using it
4. Make the "Try This" activities more specific and actionable
5. Add a sentence acknowledging that tech jargon can feel unfamiliar, and that's okay

The article has real potential—it just needs to commit to its audience.
