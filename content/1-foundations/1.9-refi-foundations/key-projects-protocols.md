# Key ReFi Projects and Protocols: The Ecosystem Map

## In This Article

This article provides an overview of significant projects and protocols in the regenerative finance ecosystem. We cover carbon markets, ecological verification, funding mechanisms, and coordination tools that make up the ReFi landscape, helping you navigate and connect with relevant initiatives.

## The Core Idea

The ReFi ecosystem consists of diverse projects using web3 tools to address environmental and social challenges. Rather than a single platform, ReFi is a network of interoperating protocols, each specializing in different aspects of regenerative coordination. Understanding the key players helps you find relevant collaborators, funding sources, and tools for your work.

These projects range from mature protocols processing millions in transactions to experimental initiatives testing new approaches. What unites them is the shared goal of using decentralized technology to fund and coordinate regeneration—whether that's carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, community development, or sustainable agriculture.

The ecosystem is rapidly evolving. New projects launch regularly, some fail, others merge or pivot. This overview captures the major categories and representative projects as of early 2025, but the landscape will continue shifting. Use this as a starting point for exploration rather than a comprehensive directory.

For regenerative practitioners, knowing the ecosystem helps you identify which projects align with your values, where to seek funding, and how different pieces might fit together in your local context. Many of these protocols are designed to be building blocks that communities can combine for their specific needs.

## Why This Matters for Regens

Understanding the ReFi ecosystem matters because no single project can address the complexity of regeneration. Effective ReFi work requires coordinating multiple tools: carbon verification for impact claims, funding mechanisms for capital, governance systems for decision-making, and marketplaces for value exchange.

Specifically, knowing the ecosystem helps you:

- **Find aligned funding**: Different ReFi protocols specialize in funding different types of work. Some focus on carbon markets, others on biodiversity, still others on community coordination. Understanding these specializations helps you target appropriate funding sources.

- **Build on existing infrastructure**: Rather than building everything from scratch, your project can integrate with established protocols for identity, verification, payments, and governance. This accelerates development and connects you to existing networks.

- **Avoid reinvention**: Many communities independently discover similar needs. Learning what protocols already exist prevents duplicating effort and allows you to contribute to shared infrastructure rather than creating isolated solutions.

- **Assess partnerships**: When potential collaborators mention ReFi protocols, understanding the landscape helps you evaluate their approach. Are they using established, audited protocols or experimental systems? Do their tools align with your values?

- **Navigate opportunities**: ReFi airdrops, grants, and participation opportunities flow through these protocols. Being familiar with the ecosystem helps you identify relevant opportunities without being overwhelmed by noise.

The ecosystem can seem complex, but you don't need to know everything. Start with protocols relevant to your immediate work, then expand knowledge as needed.

## Key Concepts

### Carbon Market Protocols

**KlimaDAO** created a treasury-backed carbon currency, creating liquidity for carbon credits and incentivizing high-quality credit retirement. Their model demonstrates how tokenomics can align financial returns with carbon removal.

**Toucan Protocol** enables tokenization of real-world carbon credits, bridging traditional voluntary carbon markets with DeFi. Their "Carbon Bridge" brings legacy credits on-chain where they can be used in new financial products.

**Moss.Earth** focuses on tokenizing Amazon forest preservation, allowing individuals and companies to directly support conservation through blockchain-based assets.

### Ecological Verification

**Regen Network** provides ecological verification infrastructure, using a combination of remote sensing and on-ground monitoring to verify regenerative land management outcomes. Their approach combines scientific rigor with blockchain transparency.

**Guardian by Hedera** offers open-source infrastructure for digital environmental asset measurement, reporting, and verification. It supports complex policy workflows while maintaining transparency.

**dMRV (Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification)** represents a category of tools using IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and AI to verify ecological outcomes with minimal human intervention, reducing verification costs and increasing trust.

### Funding Mechanisms

**Gitcoin** pioneered quadratic funding for public goods, directing millions toward open-source software and, increasingly, environmental projects. Their model amplifies broad community support over large individual donations.

**Hypercerts** creates impact certificates representing completed work, allowing funders to retrospectively reward impactful activities. This "impact markets" approach creates new funding flows for under-resourced regenerative work.

**Biodiversity Credits** protocols are emerging to create markets for species and ecosystem protection, extending beyond carbon to value the full complexity of living systems.

### Coordination Infrastructure

**ReFi DAO** itself provides coordination infrastructure for local ReFi nodes worldwide, offering playbooks, connections, and shared resources for communities building regenerative economies.

**Celo** is a mobile-first blockchain with an explicit mission of financial inclusion and environmental regeneration. Their proof-of-stake network and stablecoin infrastructure are designed for real-world use in emerging economies.

**Public Goods Funding mechanisms** like Optimism's RetroPGF reward projects based on demonstrated impact rather than promises, creating sustainable funding for open-source and public good infrastructure.

## Common Questions

**Which protocols should I start with?**

Start with protocols addressing your immediate needs. If you need funding for conservation, explore carbon and biodiversity markets. If you're building community coordination, look at DAO tools and funding mechanisms. If you need impact verification, investigate dMRV providers. You don't need to understand everything—depth in relevant areas matters more than breadth.

**How do I evaluate protocol credibility?**

Look for: transparent teams with relevant expertise, audited smart contracts, working products (not just whitepapers), active communities, and third-party verification of claims. Be skeptical of projects promising extraordinary returns or making vague impact claims. Legitimate ReFi projects welcome scrutiny and provide evidence of their work.

**Are these protocols competing or collaborating?**

Both. Some protocols compete directly (different approaches to carbon markets), while others collaborate through shared standards and composability. The ReFi ethos emphasizes coordination over winner-take-all dynamics. Many protocols explicitly design for interoperability, allowing users to combine tools from different projects.

**Can local projects use these protocols?**

Yes, most ReFi protocols are permissionless—anyone can use them without approval. However, some (particularly carbon markets) have quality standards that projects must meet. Start with protocols designed for accessibility, and consider partnering with established local ReFi nodes for guidance on more complex integrations.

**How quickly is this ecosystem changing?**

Very quickly. New protocols launch monthly, existing ones evolve, and some fail. What's current today may be outdated in a year. The core patterns—tokenized impact, decentralized funding, transparent verification—are stabilizing, but specific implementations change rapidly. Join community channels to stay updated.
