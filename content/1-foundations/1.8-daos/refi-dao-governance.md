# ReFi DAO Governance Patterns

ReFi DAO's governance framework represents an evolution in decentralized coordination—combining **optimistic governance** with **consent-based decision-making** to balance efficiency with inclusivity. This guide explores the patterns that enable a global network of Local Nodes to coordinate effectively while maintaining autonomy.

## Core Governance Philosophy

ReFi DAO operates on principles that balance **decentralized autonomy** with **collaborative alignment**:

- **Empowered Participation**: Accessible pathways for involvement without bureaucratic overhead
- **Adaptability & Evolution**: Regular retrospectives and biannual strategic planning
- **Regenerative Design**: Following natural cycles of growth, composting, and renewal
- **Trust & Transparency**: Open communication and accountability as foundational values

The system aims to enable **agile decision-making** while ensuring decisions are "good enough for now, safe enough to try."

---

## Pattern 1: Optimistic Consent-Based Governance

ReFi DAO's primary decision-making model combines two complementary approaches:

### Optimistic Governance

**"Default to Action"**

In optimistic governance, decisions are assumed approved unless explicitly challenged:

- Proposals move forward unless someone raises a formal objection within a defined timeframe
- Built on trust that participants act in good faith and alignment with shared goals
- Enables rapid experimentation and reduces decision-making bottlenecks
- Particularly effective for routine, low-risk decisions

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fast execution and reduced overhead
- Encourages innovation through low barrier to action
- Requires robust challenge mechanisms for accountability
- Depends on high-trust environment

### Consent-Based Governance

**"Good Enough for Now, Safe Enough to Try"**

Consent-based governance focuses on moving forward with decisions that meet minimum thresholds of safety and alignment:

- Decisions proceed unless there are **valid objections** (not just preferences)
- A valid objection demonstrates potential harm, risk, or misalignment with mission/values
- Emphasizes "absence of objections" rather than unanimous agreement
- Decisions are treated as experiments that can be revisited and refined

**The Standard:**
> "Is this proposal good enough for now and safe enough to try?"

This question guides evaluation, prioritizing progress over perfection while preventing harmful decisions.

### Combined Implementation

ReFi DAO layers these approaches based on decision stakes:

| Decision Type | Governance Model | Example |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Routine/Operational | Optimistic | Small event funding, content creation |
| Strategic/Structural | Consent-Based | Biannual planning, role changes |
| Mission-Critical | Full Consent | Charter amendments, major partnerships |

## Pattern 2: The DACI Decision-Making Framework

For complex decisions requiring clear accountability, ReFi DAO uses the **DACI** framework:

### DACI Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Authority |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **D - Driver** | Coordinates the process, gathers input, ensures forward momentum | Organizes discussions, manages timeline |
| **A - Approver** | Makes the final decision, accountable for outcomes | Authority to approve/reject/modify |
| **C - Contributors** | Provide input, expertise, and data to inform decisions | Voice in shaping proposals |
| **I - Informed** | Notified of decisions after they're made | No direct input, but affected by outcomes |

### How DACI Works

1. **Driver** initiates the process and identifies Contributors
2. **Contributors** provide perspectives, data, and expertise
3. **Driver** synthesizes input into a recommendation
4. **Approver** makes the final decision
5. **Informed** parties are updated on outcomes

This framework prevents confusion about who has authority while ensuring diverse perspectives inform decisions.

**Example: Biannual Strategic Planning**

| Role | Assignment |
|------|------------|
| Driver | Source Lead + Core Stewards |
| Approvers | DAO Voting Members (consent-based vote) |
| Contributors | Local Node Leads, Initiative Leads, Community |
| Informed | General ReFi public, partner organizations |

---

## Pattern 3: Biannual Strategic Cycles

ReFi DAO operates on **biannual strategic planning cycles** that embody regenerative design principles.

### The Cycle Structure

Each 6-month period includes:

**1. Proposal Creation Phase**
- Source Lead and Core Stewards draft strategic plan
- Input gathered from Local Nodes, Initiatives, and Contributors
- Plan includes objectives, priorities, roles, and resource allocation

**2. Review & Refinement Phase**
- Draft shared with DAO Voting Members for feedback
- Contributors and Supporting Members invited to raise concerns
- Focus on ensuring plan is "safe enough to try"
- Objections must include suggestions for improvement

**3. Consent-Based Voting**
- Voting Members cast consent votes:
  - **Full consent**: Support the plan
  - **Consent with reservations**: Minor concerns, willing to proceed
  - **Object**: Strong objection requiring revision
- Proposal blocked only if 10-30% (threshold varies) vote to Object

**4. Ratification & Communication**
- Plan ratified if no blocking threshold reached
- Public announcement across community channels
- Informed parties notified of strategic direction

**5. Implementation & Feedback**
- Execution by Core Stewards and Initiative Leads
- Quarterly updates on progress, metrics, challenges
- Ongoing adjustments as needed

### Regenerative Renewal

Following natural cycles, the biannual process:

- **Reviews all key roles** for active engagement
- **Composts inactive initiatives** that no longer serve the mission
- **Creates space** for new leaders and ideas to emerge
- **Resets priorities** based on evolving network needs

This prevents organizational stagnation and ensures the DAO remains dynamic and adaptive.

## Pattern 4: Network Governance Structure

ReFi DAO's governance operates across multiple interconnected layers:

### ReFi DAO Global

The core coordination body responsible for:
- Strategic planning and high-level documentation
- Financial management and resource allocation
- Network oversight and support for Local Nodes
- Governance and policy development

**Roles within Global:**

| Role | Function | Governance Participation |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| **Source Lead** | Vision stewardship, strategic direction | Guides governance processes |
| **Core Stewards** | Operational leadership, proposal review | Full voting rights |
| **Core Contributors** | Domain expertise, project execution | Voting as appropriate |
| **Advisors** | Strategic guidance on as-needed basis | Advisory input |

### Local Nodes

Autonomous, place-based communities that:
- Self-govern according to local context
- Maintain alignment with global mission and values
- Participate in network governance when affected
- Report transparently on activities and impact

**Local Node Governance:**
- Full autonomy over local operations
- Encouraged (not required) participation in global governance
- Transparent financial and impact reporting
- Annual review for continued active status

### Network Initiatives

Thematic projects and guilds (e.g., ReFi Podcast, Prosperity Passport) that:
- Operate independently with own teams and resources
- Align with network mission and brand identity
- Participate in governance when decisions impact their work
- Share learnings with broader community

---

## Pattern 5: Conflict Resolution

ReFi DAO employs a tiered approach to resolving disagreements:

### Tier 1: Dialogue

- Open, respectful communication between involved parties
- Focus on clarifying misunderstandings
- Exploring mutually agreeable solutions

### Tier 2: Mediation

- Neutral mediator from the community facilitates resolution
- May involve Core Stewards or trusted contributors
- Aim to restore clarity, trust, and alignment

### Tier 3: Community Review

- Matter brought to broader community via governance forums
- Community members offer insight and propose responses
- Restorative approaches prioritized over punitive measures

### Tier 4: Formal Action

For persistent or severe breaches:
- Warnings and temporary participation restrictions
- Membership composting or revocation in extreme cases
- Last resort after good-faith resolution attempts

**Third-Party Mediation Options:**
- **Gravity DAO**: Community-led mediation for DAOs
- **Kleros**: Decentralized arbitration system
- **Ostrom5**: Collective action challenge resolution

---

## Pattern 6: Onboarding & Offboarding

Governance includes clear processes for role transitions:

### Onboarding Key Roles

| Role | Driver | Process |
|------|--------|---------|
| Core Stewards | Source Lead | Invitation with Core Steward consent |
| Local Node Leads | Proposal Creator | Approved Local Node proposal |
| Network Members | Individual | Join Garden + sign Community Covenant |

### Offboarding Principles

- **Voluntary**: Members may step down with notice (typically 1 month)
- **Natural**: Inactive members offboarded during biannual reviews
- **Involuntary**: For misalignment or harm, after attempts at resolution
- **Transition**: Handover of responsibilities documented

The offboarding process embodies regenerative principles—"composting" roles creates space for renewal and new growth.
