# Donor Stewardship in Web3

You got a crypto donation. Great! Now what?

Stewardship is about relationship, not transaction. Crypto donors are just like other donors—they want to know their gift matters. But there are some unique things to consider.

## Thank Them Fast

Within 24 hours of receiving a crypto donation:
- Send a personalized thank you
- Include the transaction ID (blockchain proof)
- Explain what their gift will do

This is basic donor care, but it goes far with crypto donors who may be used to anonymous transactions.

## Provide Impact Updates

Crypto donors gave something that could have appreciated in value. They're making a real sacrifice. Show them the impact.

Ways to do this:
- Send photo updates from your programs
- Share stories of people helped
- Show the crypto-to-impact equation ("0.1 ETH = 5 school kits")

## Understand Their Motivation

Crypto donors often care about:
- Transparency (they can see onchain where funds go)
- Global access (they care about people everywhere)
- Innovation (they want to support new models)

Speak to these motivations in your communications.

## Blockchain Transparency

Here's something cool: you can share onchain proof of how funds are used. Some nonprofits publish wallet addresses that donors can track.

This builds trust in a way traditional finance can't match.

## Build Community

Consider:
- Hosting special calls for major crypto donors
- Inviting them to see your work in person
- Creating a "crypto supporters" recognition tier

These supporters are pioneering. Make them feel part of something.

## The Bottom Line

Crypto donors deserve the same great stewardship as any donor—plus some extra transparency. Show impact, build relationship, and let them be part of your mission's future.

## Try This

1. **Draft a thank-you template** – Write one for crypto donors specifically
2. **Plan an impact update** – What would you send 3 months after a crypto gift?
3. **Consider onchain transparency** – Could you publish a donor address?
