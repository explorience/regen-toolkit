# Crypto Donation Platforms: What You Need to Know

So you're ready to accept crypto. Now the question is: how?

That's where donation platforms come in. These services handle the technical stuff so you don't have to.

## What Do These Platforms Do?

Think of a crypto donation platform like a specialized version of PayPal or Stripe—but for charitable giving. They:

- Provide a landing page where donors can give crypto
- Handle the blockchain transactions
- Convert crypto to dollars (if you want)
- Send you the funds via bank transfer
- Provide tax receipts for donors

## Popular Options

### The Giving Block
One of the largest. Used by many major nonprofits. Offers a suite of tools beyond just accepting donations.

### Infinite Giving
Designed specifically for nonprofits. Focuses on ease of use. Good for smaller organizations just starting out.

### CryptoAltruists
A directory and resource hub. Helps you find platforms that fit your needs.

### Other Options
- Causes (Facebook giving)
- Binance Charity
- Alchemy Pay

## What to Look For

When choosing a platform, consider:

1. **Fees** – Some charge a percentage, some are free for nonprofits
2. **Supported cryptocurrencies** – How many different cryptos can people send?
3. **Instant conversion** – Can donors convert to stablecoins so you don't deal with volatility?
4. **Integration** – Does it work with your existing donor management system?
5. **Support** – Can they help you get set up?

## Getting Started

Most platforms make it pretty simple:

1. Create an account
2. Verify your nonprofit (usually need 501(c)(3) status or equivalent)
3. Customize your donation page
4. Add the link to your website
5. Tell people!

## Do You Need Technical Skills?

Not really. These platforms are built for non-technical users. You won't need to know anything about wallets, private keys, or blockchain.

The platform handles all of that. You just get the donations.

## The Bottom Line

Don't let the technology intimidate you. Crypto donation platforms have done the hard work. Your job is just to pick one and sign up.
