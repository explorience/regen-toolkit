# Setting Up to Receive Crypto: A Step-by-Step Guide

Ready to accept cryptocurrency donations? Here's how to get started in 5 simple steps.

## Step 1: Choose Your Platform

We covered this in the previous article, but here's a quick recap:

- **The Giving Block** – Full-featured, used by big nonprofits
- **Infinite Giving** – Simple, great for small orgs
- **Startssl** – Another option to explore

Pick one that fits your budget and needs.

## Step 2: Verify Your Nonprofit Status

Most platforms require proof of nonprofit status:
- 501(c)(3) letter (US)
- Equivalent documentation in your country
- Organization registration

Have these documents ready.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Account

Once verified:
- Create your organization profile
- Upload your logo
- Write a short description
- Choose which cryptocurrencies to accept

You can start with just Bitcoin and Ethereum, then add more later.

## Step 4: Connect to Your Website

The platform will give you:
- A donate button
- A dedicated donation page
- Widget code to embed

Add these to your website just like any other donate button.

## Step 5: Test It

Before going live:
- Make a test donation yourself
- Check that thank-you emails work
- Verify you receive notifications
- Confirm funds appear in your dashboard

Now you're ready.

## What About Taxes?

Set up your accounts to generate tax receipts automatically. Most platforms do this. Your donors will need:
- Transaction ID
- USD value at time of donation
- Your organization's EIN

## Common Setup Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't skip testing** – Always test with a small amount first
2. **Don't accept everything** – Start with major coins, add exotic ones later
3. **Don't forget to announce** – Put it on your website and social media

## The Bottom Line

Setting up takes about an hour with most platforms. The hardest part is gathering your nonprofit documents. After that, it's just like adding any other payment option.
