# Case Studies: How Nonprofits Are Using Web3

When the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, banks froze. International wires stalled. But crypto kept moving. In just the first week, the Ukrainian government raised over $50 million in bitcoin and other digital assets [Source: cryptoaltruism.org]. NGOs like Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee received funds within hours—long before traditional transfers cleared.

That moment showed the world something important: web3 tools aren't just for traders. They're becoming real infrastructure for nonprofits doing life-changing work.

## Why This Matters Now

If you run a community garden, a neighborhood nonprofit, or a local charity, you might wonder: "Does this apply to me?"

Here's the answer: yes. Here's why it's worth paying attention:

**Crypto donations are growing fast.** More than $1 billion in crypto was donated to nonprofits in 2024—a 386% increase from the year before [Source: The Giving Block]. Even more striking? About 70% of Forbes' Top 100 US charities now accept crypto, up from just 12% in 2020 [Source: cryptoaltruism.org]. The big organizations noticed the shift. Now it's reaching smaller groups too.

**It's not just about big crises.** Beyond emergency response, nonprofits are using crypto for everyday operations. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to the US dollar—they don't swing in value like bitcoin, making them practical for organizations that need predictable budgets. The tools work for small teams, not just large NGOs with dedicated finance staff.

## Real Examples

### Ukraine: When Traditional Finance Failed

When banks couldn't keep up with the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, crypto stepped in. The Ukrainian government raised millions through official crypto wallets. Community fundraisers like UkraineDAO added millions more.

What made this work?
- Transfers happened in minutes, not days
- Every donation was traceable on the public blockchain
- No need for correspondent banks or institutional approvals

"Support moved quickly without banking delays, transfers cleared even as the local currency collapsed, and every donation was recorded transparently onchain," notes CryptoAltruists [Source: cryptoaltruism.org].

### Stablecoins Cutting Costs

Here's one number to remember: **60%**.

That's how much Mercy Corps Ventures cut delivery costs by using stablecoins (cryptocurrencies tied to the US dollar) instead of traditional money transfers in Syria [Source: cryptoaltruism.org]. Lower costs mean more impact per dollar for the people you serve.

### Smaller Organizations Catching On

It's not just the big players. Nonprofits focused on climate, education, and community development are starting to explore these tools. If you're curious, you're in good company.

## What This Means for Your Organization

You don't need to become a crypto expert to benefit. Here's the simple version:

1. **Accept crypto donations** – Platforms like The Giving Block make this as easy as adding a donate button
2. **Usecoins for stable cross-border payments** – If you work with partners internationally, stablecoins can reduce fees and delays
3. **Build transparency into your reporting** – Blockchain records can show donors exactly where funds go

## The Bottom Line

Web3 isn't just a buzzword for techies anymore. It's becoming practical infrastructure for the giving world.

Tammy Tibbetts, CEO of She's the First, put it this way: "In the most challenging fiscal year of my career as a nonprofit CEO, I realized I had to take crypto seriously. If I didn't, the ship was going to sail without us" [Source: The Giving Block].

You don't have to jump in headfirst. But watching how other nonprofits are using these tools—and thinking about whether they could help your mission—is worth your time.
