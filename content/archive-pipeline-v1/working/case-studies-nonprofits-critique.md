# Critique: case-studies-nonprofits.md

## Persona: Maya (Grounded Regen)

### Read as: A permaculture teacher running a community garden nonprofit

## What Confused Me?
- The article mentions "stablecoins" but doesn't explain what they are until later
- Could use a clearer transition from big examples to small orgs

## What's Still Unclear?
- How do I actually set this up for my small nonprofit? (The "Try This" section helps but could be more specific)
- Are there fees involved?

## What's Missing?
- At least one example of a small/mid-sized nonprofit (not just big NGOs)
- A brief explanation of what stablecoins are early on

## Did This Respect My Time?
- Yes. Concise, practical, didn't drown in jargon
- Good mix of big-picture context and specific examples

## Verdict: NEEDS MINOR REVISIONS

Suggested fixes:
1. Add 1-sentence explanation of stablecoins early: "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tied to the US dollar—they don't swing in value like bitcoin"
2. Consider adding one smaller nonprofit example if available

---
**Overall:** Good foundation. With the stablecoin clarification, this works for Maya.
