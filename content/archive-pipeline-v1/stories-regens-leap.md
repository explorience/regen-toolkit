# Stories: Regens Who Made the Leap

Sometimes, the best way to understand is to see what others have done. Here are real stories of people in regenerative spaces who decided to explore web3.

## Maria's Community Garden

Maria runs an urban community garden in a food desert. She heard about crypto donations but thought it wasn't for "people like her."

One day, a local developer asked if they could accept crypto for a fundraising campaign. "Why not?" she said.

The result: a $5,000 ETH donation from someone across the country who'd never visited the garden but believed in the mission.

"The tech was the hard part—finding the right platform," Maria says. "But the donation itself was the easiest thing."

## The Climate Coalition

A coalition of 15 environmental nonprofits wanted to pool resources for a campaign. They'd previously used a traditional bank account, but transparency was always an issue.

They moved their treasury to a multi-sig wallet (a crypto account requiring multiple approvals). Now:
- Every member can see exactly where funds are
- Decisions happen through onchain voting
- They can accept donations from anywhere

"We spent months debating," says one organizer. "But once we switched, our coalition actually functioned better."

## ReFi Africa

A group of African entrepreneurs built a regenerative finance community from scratch. They used:
- Discord for communication
- Gitcoin for funding
- Snapshot for decisions
- POAPs to recognize contributors

None of them were "crypto experts." They learned as they went.

"We didn't need permission," they say. "We just started building."

## What These Stories Have in Common

1. **Started small** – None of them went all-in immediately
2. **Found allies** – Each had at least one person who understood the tech
3. **Kept learning** – They made mistakes and adjusted
4. **Stayed focused on mission** – The tech served the cause, not the reverse

## You Can Do This

You don't need:
- A computer science degree
- A huge budget
- To understand everything

You need:
- A mission you believe in
- Willingness to try something new
- Patience to learn

That's it.

## The Bottom Line

Every regen who's entered web3 started exactly where you are now. They had questions. They felt uncertain. But they took one small step, then another.

Your story could be next.

## Try This

1. **Find one person** – Is there someone in your network who knows a little about web3?
2. **Ask them to coffee** – Let them share what they know
3. **Pick one thing** – What's one small step you could take this month?
