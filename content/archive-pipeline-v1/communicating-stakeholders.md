# Communicating with Stakeholders About Crypto

So you want to start accepting crypto donations. That's great! But before you add that donate button, there's one thing you can't skip: talking to your people.

We're talking about your board, your staff, your major donors, and anyone else who cares about your organization. Here's how to have those conversations.

## Start with Education

Before your board votes on accepting crypto, everyone needs to understand what it is. Not in depth—just enough to make an informed decision.

"Before accepting a gift of cryptocurrency, it was important to educate our Leadership Team, our Board of Trustees, and our Donors, about crypto, based on facts," says one nonprofit leader [Source: nonprofitfinancials.org]. Those conversations helped them "make the right decision whether to accept or not."

Here's what to cover:
- What crypto is (in simple terms)
- How donations would work
- What happens when you receive crypto
- Any risks and how you're addressing them

## Talk to Your Board

Your board has fiduciary responsibility. They need to understand:
- Is this legal? (Yes, in most places)
- What are the tax implications for donors?
- What are the risks to the organization?
- How will you manage crypto assets?

Come prepared. Have answers ready. Show them how other similar nonprofits have handled this.

## Address Risks Openly

Don't pretend there are no concerns. Your stakeholders will respect you more for being honest.

Common concerns include:
- Volatility (the value could go up or down)
- Security (how will you protect the crypto?)
- Complexity (will this create more work?)

For each concern, explain how you'll manage it. For volatility, you might convert donations to US dollars right away. For security, you might use a reputable platform that handles the technical details.

## Communicate with Donors

Once you're ready to accept crypto, tell people! Use multiple channels:
- Email newsletters
- Social media posts
- Your website
- In-person conversations

"Use multiple communication channels to spread the word about your new donation option, and emphasize the benefits for donors," suggests Infinite Giving [Source: infinitegiving.com].

What are those benefits?
- Avoid capital gains taxes (in the US)
- Donors can give larger amounts
- It's fast and global
- It attracts younger, tech-savvy supporters

## Create Simple Templates

You don't have to write everything from scratch. Create basic templates for:
- Explaining crypto donations to curious donors
- Announcing your new option on social media
- Responding to questions from skeptics

Keep it simple. Most people don't need a deep dive—they just need enough to feel comfortable.

## The Bottom Line

Talking about crypto with your stakeholders doesn't have to be scary. Be honest, be prepared, and focus on how this helps your mission.

Your board wants to do the right thing. Your donors want to support you. When you frame crypto as another tool for impact—not a risky gamble—you'll find people are more open than you expected.
