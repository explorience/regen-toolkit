# How Web3 Relates to Your Existing Work

You already have a mission. You already have work. Where does web3 fit in?

The answer: as a tool, not a replacement. Here's how to think about it.

## It's an Addition, Not a Replacement

Web3 won't replace your:
- Community relationships
- Program delivery
- Mission-driven team
- Physical presence

What it can add:
- New funding sources
- Better transparency
- Global reach
- Coordination tools

Think of it like your website. It's a tool that supports your work—it doesn't replace the actual work.

## Find the Fit

Ask yourself: where are my current pain points?

### Fundraising
- Are you losing donors to other causes?
- Do you want to reach new audiences?
- Is international giving difficult?

→ Web3 can help with crypto donations, new donor demographics

### Transparency  
- Do donors ask where money goes?
- Is reporting time-consuming?
- Do you want stronger trust?

→ Blockchain transparency can verify your impact

### Coordination
- Do you work with partners globally?
- Is decision-making slow?
- Do you need better tools for community input?

→ DAOs and governance tools can help

### Community Building
- Want to reward supporters?
- Need ways to verify participation?
- Want supporters to feel ownership?

→ Tokens and credentials can create belonging

## Start Small

You don't need to rebuild everything. Pick one small use case:

1. Add a crypto donate option (just a button!)
2. Try a Snapshot vote for one decision
3. Issue a POAP for an event
4. Publish your budget onchain

Learn by doing.

## Keep What Works

Not everything needs to move to web3. Keep the parts of your work that function well. Only change what's broken or could be better.

The goal is impact, not technology for its own sake.

## The Bottom Line

Web3 is a set of tools. Your mission is the point. Let the tools serve the mission, not the other way around.

## Try This

1. **Identify one pain point** – What's one frustration in your current work?
2. **Search for a web3 solution** – Is there a tool that might help?
3. **Try one small thing** – Add one web3 element to your next event or campaign
