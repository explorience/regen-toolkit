# Regen Toolkit

**An "Intro to Web3 from a Regen Angle"** - A comprehensive, open-source resource for regenerative practitioners entering the Web3 space.

## What is the Regen Toolkit?

The Regen Toolkit is a curated, modular framework that synthesizes existing resources while filling critical gaps. It creates clear learning pathways for multiple audiences entering Web3 from different directions.

**Key differentiator:** This isn't another incomplete partial toolkit. It *connects the dots* between existing resources and provides easy entry points for different audiences.

## Target Audiences

The toolkit serves **three distinct audiences** entering from different directions:

### 🌱 The Grounded Regen
- **Who they are:** Permaculturists, community organizers, nonprofit workers, activists who've never touched crypto
- **What they need:** "Why should I care about blockchain? How does this help my real work?"
- **Entry point:** Track 1 (Foundations)

### 💰 The Curious Degen
- **Who they are:** Crypto-native folks who want to do something meaningful with their skills/capital
- **What they need:** "I get the tech, but how do I find legit impact projects? How do I avoid greenwashing?"
- **Entry point:** Track 2 (Applied) + Track 3 (Playbooks)

### 🔄 The On-Chain Regen
- **Who they are:** Already in ReFi/web3 impact space, wants to go deeper or start local initiatives
- **What they need:** "How do I start a local node? What patterns work? How do I bring others in?"
- **Entry point:** Track 2 (Local Nodes) + Track 3 (Playbooks)
