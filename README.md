# Regen Toolkit

Practical web3 knowledge for regenerative communities.

**Live site:** [regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app](https://regen-toolkit-site.vercel.app)

## What Is This?

- Environmental practitioners exploring impact verification
- Local chapter builders setting up web3 coordination
- DAO operators and governance researchers

## Current State

- **67 published articles** across foundations, applied topics, and playbooks
- **254 total articles** in the taxonomy (remaining are stubs in progress)
- **5 learning paths** through the content for different audiences
- **Interactive Knowledge Explorer** mapping all topics and connections
- **Tag Explorer** for filtering by function, domain, systems concepts, audience, and maturity
