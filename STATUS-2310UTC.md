## 🎯 READY TO START (Now)

With Gnosis Safe research complete, I can begin:

### Option A: Draft Gnosis Safe Playbook NOW
Use the completed research to start writing the actual playbook article.

### Option B: Wait for All Research (Recommended)
Better to have all 3 research reports before drafting playbooks for consistency.

### Option C: Prepare Templates/Structure
